<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Cornwall, peopled mainly by Celts, but
with an infusion of English blood, stands and
always has stood apart from the rest of England,
much, but in a less degree, as has
Wales. That which brought it into more intimate
association with English thought, interests, and progress
was the loss of the old Cornish tongue.</p>

<p>The isolation in which Cornwall had stood has
tended to develop in it much originality of character;
and the wildness of the coast has bred a hardy race of
seamen and smugglers; the mineral wealth, moreover,
drew thousands of men underground, and the underground
life of the mines has a peculiar effect on mind
and character: it is cramping in many ways, but it
tends to develop a good deal of religious enthusiasm,
that occasionally breaks forth in wild forms of fanaticism.
Cornwall has produced admirable sailors, men
who have won deathless renown in warfare at sea, as
"Old Dreadnought" Boscawen, Pellew, Lord Exmouth,
etc., and daring and adventurous smugglers,
like "The King of Prussia," who combined great
religious fervour with entire absence of scruple in the
matter of defrauding the king's revenue. It has produced
men of science who have made for themselves
a world-fame, as Adams the astronomer, and Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Humphry Davy the chemist; men who have been
benefactors to their race, as Henry Trengrouse, Sir
Goldsworthy Gurney, and Trevithick. It has sent
forth at least one notable painter, the miner's boy Opie,
and a dramatist, Samuel Foote, and a great singer in
his day, Incledon. But it has not given to literature
a great poet. Minor rhymes have been produced in
great quantities, but none of great worth. Philosophers
have issued from the mines, as Samuel Drew,
eccentrics many, as Sir James Tillie, John Knill, and
Daniel Gumb. And Cornwall has contributed a
certain number of rascals&mdash;but fewer in number than
almost any other county, if we exclude wreckers and
smugglers from the catalogue of rascality.</p>

<p>Strange superstitions have lingered on, and one very
curious story of a girl fed for years by fairies has been
put on record.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that Cornwall has produced
no musical genius of any note; and yet the
Cornishman is akin to the Welshman and the Irishman.</p>

<p>Cornwall has certainly sent up to London and
Westminster very able politicians, as Godolphin, Sir
William Molesworth, and Sir John Eliot. It furnished
Tyburn with a victim&mdash;Hugh Peters, the chaplain of
Oliver Cromwell, a strange mixture of money-grasping,
enthusiasm, and humour.</p>

<p>It has been the object of the author, not to retell the
lives of the greatest of the sons of Cornwall, for these
lives may be read in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>, but to chronicle the stories of lesser
luminaries concerning whom less is known and little
is easily accessible. In this way it serves as a companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
volume to <i>Devonshire Characters</i>; and Cornwall
in no particular falls short of Devonshire in the
variety of characters it has sent forth, nor are their
stories of less interest.</p>

<p>The author and publisher have to thank many for
kind help: Mr. Percy Bate, Mr. T. R. Bolitho, Rev.
A. T. Boscawen, Mr. J. A. Bridger, Mr. T. Walter
Brimacombe, Mr. A. M. Broadley, Mr. R. P. Chope,
Mr. Digby Collins, Mr. J. B. Cornish, Mrs. Coryton
of Pentillie Castle, Miss Loveday E. Drake, Mr.
E. H. W. Dunkin, <span class="smcap">f.s.a.</span>, Mr. J. D. Enys of Enys,
the Rev. Wm. Iago, Mrs. H. Forbes Julian, Mrs.
de Lacy Lacy, the Rev. A. H. Malan, Mr. Lewis
Melville, Mr. A. H. Norway, Captain Rogers of Penrose,
Mr. Thomas Seccombe, Mr. Henry Trengrouse,
Mr. W. H. K. Wright, and Mr. Henry Young of
Liverpool&mdash;and last, but not least, Miss Windeatt
Roberts for her admirable Index to the volume.</p>

<p>The publisher wishes me to say that he would
much like to discover the whereabouts of a full-length
portrait of Sir John Call, with a view of Bodmin Gaol
in the background.</p>

<h1>CORNISH
CHARACTERS<br /></h1>
<h2>AND STRANGE EVENTS<br /><br /></h2>


<h2>WILLIAM PENGELLY, GEOLOGIST</h2>

<p>William Pengelly was born at East
Looe on January 12th, 1812, and was the
son of the captain of a small coasting
vessel and nephew of a notorious smuggler.
The Pengellys had, in fact, been connected with
the sea for several generations. His mother was a
Prout of the same family as the famous water-colour
artist.</p>

<p>As a child his career was almost cut short by fire.
An aunt came to stay with the Pengellys, arriving a
day before she was expected. Early on the following
morning, when sitting in her bedroom window, wrapped
in a thick woollen shawl, she saw her little nephew
William rush out of the house enveloped in flames.
She hurried after him, and managed to smother the fire
with her woollen garment, and thus saved the child's
life, though she was herself so badly burnt that she
carried the scars to her dying day. The little boy had
risen early, and had kindled a fire so that he might go
on with his lessons before any one else was astir in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
house, with the result that he set light to his clothes,
and except for the premature arrival of his aunt, must
certainly have been burnt to death.</p>

<p>At the age of twelve he went to sea. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our voyages were short. I do not remember an
instance of being at sea more than three consecutive
days; so that, except when windbound, we were almost
always taking in or taking out cargo. The work was
hard, but the food was abundant, and on the whole the
life, though rough, was not unpleasant.</p>

<p>"To me&mdash;thinking nothing of the pecuniary aspects
of the question&mdash;the most enjoyable occasions were
those which fierce contrary winds brought us, when we
had to seek some harbour of refuge. These were by
no means necessarily holidays, for, if the weather were
dry, advantage was taken of the enforced leisure to
give our craft a thorough cleaning, or to repair her
rigging, or to make up the books. Moreover, the crew
employed me to write letters to their wives from their
dictation. These epistles were generally of a remarkable
character, and some of them remain firmly fixed
in my memory. The foregoing labours disposed of,
and foul winds still prevailing, we had a washing day,
or, better than all, a bout of tailoring, which did not
generally get beyond repairing, though occasionally
the ambitious flight of making a pair of trousers
was attempted. On tailoring days it was understood
that my clothes should be repaired for me, in order
that I might read aloud for the general benefit. We
assembled in our little cabin, where the stitching and
smoking went on simultaneously, and with great
vigour. My poor library consisted of a Bible, the
eighth volume of the <i>Spectator</i>, Johnson's <i>English
Dictionary</i>, a volume of the <i>Weekly Miscellany</i>, the
<i>History of John Gilpin</i>, <i>Baron Munchausen's Travels</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Walkinghame's <i>Arithmetic</i>, and a book of songs.
My hearers were not very fastidious, but allowed me to
read pretty much what I pleased, though, truth to tell,
the <i>Spectator</i> was not a favourite; some portions of it
were held to be nonsensical, and others were considered
to be so lacking in truthfulness that it was generally
termed the 'lying book.' This ill repute was largely
due to the story of Fadlallah (No. 578). Walkinghame
was by no means unpopular. I occasionally read some
of the questions, and my shipmates endeavoured to
solve them mentally; and as the answers were all given
by the author, I had to declare who had made the
nearest guess, for it was very often but little more. Of
all the questions, none excited so much interest as that
which asks, What will be the cost of shoeing a horse at
a farthing for the first nail, two for the second, and so
on in geometrical progression for thirty-two nails,
and which gives for the answer a sum but little short of
four and a half million pounds sterling. This was so
utterly unexpected that it went far to confer on Walkinghame
the same name that Fadlallah had given to the
<i>Spectator</i>."</p>

<p>William Pengelly tells a curious story of his father,
Richard Pengelly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After completing his fifteenth year he was thinking
of going to sea. When he was sixteen, his father, who
was a sailor, was drowned almost within sight of his
home. The effect on the boy was to make him pause,
and on his friends, to urge him to give up the idea.
For some months these influences kept him quiet, but
at length his restlessness returned so strongly, that he
would have gone to sea at once, had he felt satisfied
that his father would have approved the step. To
ascertain this point he prayed frequently and earnestly
that his father's spirit might be allowed to appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
him, with a pleasing or frowning aspect, according as
he might approve or disapprove. At length he
believed his prayer to have been answered, and that
when in the field ploughing he saw his father, who
passed by looking intently and smilingly at him. This
decided him. He became a sailor at seventeen, and as
such died at a good old age."</p>

<p>One bitterly cold night at sea, young Pengelly and
some other of his shipmates having closed the cabin
door, lit a charcoal fire, and speedily fell asleep, succumbing
to the fumes of carbonic acid. Happily one
of the crew who had been on deck entered the cabin.
He found the greatest difficulty in awakening his comrades
to sufficient consciousness to enable them to
stumble up the ladder to get a breath of fresh air, for
their sleep had well-nigh become that of death. The
strong and hardy seamen soon recovered, but the boy
was so seriously affected that, long after he had been
carried upon deck, he could not be roused, and was
only restored to consciousness by means of prolonged
exertions on the part of his shipmates. His earliest
geological experience was made when a sailor-boy
weather-bound on the Dorsetshire coast, and he was
wont to relate it thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I received my first lesson in geology at Lyme
Regis, very soon after I had entered my teens. A
labourer, whom I was observing, accidentally broke a
large stone of blue lias and thus disclosed a fine ammonite
&mdash;the first fossil of any kind that I had ever seen
or heard of.</p>

<p>"In reply to my exclamation, 'What's that?' the
workman said, with a sneer, 'If you had read your
Bible you'd know what 'tis.' 'I <i>have</i> read my Bible.
But what has that to do with it?'</p>

<p>"'In the Bible we're told there was once a flood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
covered all the world. At that time all the rocks
were mud, and the different things that were drowned
were buried in it, and there's a snake that was buried
that way. There are lots of 'em, and other things
besides, in the rocks and stones hereabouts.'</p>

<p>"'A snake! But where's his head?'</p>

<p>"'You must read the Bible, I tell 'ee, and then you'll
find out why 'tis that some of the snakes in the rocks
ain't got no heads. We're told there, that the seed of
the woman shall bruise the serpent's head, that's how
'tis.'"</p>

<p>When in his sixteenth year William Pengelly lost
his younger brother, and after that his mother would
not suffer him to go to sea. Some years were spent at
Looe in self-education.</p>

<p>While still quite young he was induced by a relative
of his mother to settle at Torquay, at that time a small
place, but rapidly growing and attracting residents to
it. Here he opened a small day-school on the Pestalozzian
system, and was one of the first to introduce the
use of the blackboard and chalk. The school opened
with six scholars, but rapidly increased to about seventy.</p>

<p>It was now that scientific studies began to occupy
Pengelly's attention, and above all, geology.</p>

<p>In 1837 he married Mary Anne Mudge, whose health
was always delicate.</p>

<p>Little by little his renown as a geologist spread, and
he did not confine himself to the deposits in Devonshire,
but travelled to Scotland and elsewhere to examine the
rocks, and to meet and consult with eminent scientists.</p>

<p>In 1846 his private pupils had grown so numerous
that he was able to give up his school altogether and
become a tutor of mathematics and the natural sciences.
He tells a very amusing story of a visit made during
holiday time to an old friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I one day learned that my road lay within a couple
of miles of the rectory of my old mathematical friend
D&mdash;&mdash;. We had been great friends when he was a
curate in a distant part of the country, but had not
met for several years, during which he had been advanced
from a curacy of about £80 to a rectory of £200
per year, and a residence, in a very secluded district.
My time was very short, but for 'auld lang syne' I
decided to sacrifice a few hours. On reaching the
house Mr. and Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash; were fortunately at home,
and received me with their wonted kindness.</p>

<p>"The salutations were barely over, when I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It is now six o'clock; I must reach Wellington tonight,
and as it is said to be fully eight miles off, and I
am utterly unacquainted with the road, and with the
town when I reach it, I cannot remain with you one
minute after eight o'clock.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, very well,' said D&mdash;&mdash;, 'then we must improve
the shining hour. Jane, my dear, be so good as
to order tea.'</p>

<p>"Having said this he left the room. In a few
minutes he returned with a book under his arm and his
hands filled with writing materials, which he placed on
the table. Opening the book, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'This is Hind's <i>Trigonometry</i>, and here's a lot of
examples for practice. Let us see which can do the
greatest number of them by eight o'clock. I did most
of them many years ago, but I have not looked at
them since. Suppose we begin at this one'&mdash;which he
pointed out&mdash;'and take them as they come. We can
drink our tea as we work, so as to lose no time.'</p>

<p>"'All right,' said I; though it was certainly not the
object for which I had come out of my road.</p>

<p>"Accordingly we set to work. No words passed
between us; the servant brought in the tray, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
D&mdash;&mdash; handed us our tea, which we drank now and
then, and the time flew on rapidly. At length, finding
it to be a quarter to eight&mdash;</p>

<p>"'We must stop,' said I, 'for in a quarter of an
hour I must be on my road.'</p>

<p>"'Very well. Let us see how our answers agree
with those of the author.'</p>

<p>"It proved that he had correctly solved one more
than I had. This point settled, I said 'Good-bye.'</p>

<p>"'Good-bye. Do come again as soon as you can.
The farmers know nothing whatever about Trigonometry.'</p>

<p>"We parted at the rectory door, and have never met
since; nor shall we ever do so more, as his decease occurred
several years ago. During my long walk to
Wellington my mind was chiefly occupied with the
mental isolation of a rural clergyman."</p>

<p>In 1851 he lost his wife, and some years after both
his children by her.</p>

<p>In 1853 he married a Lydia Spriggs, a Quakeress.</p>

<p>William Pengelly's scientific explorations may be
divided under three heads. The first was his minute
and accurate examination of the deposits that form
Bovey Heathfield, where there are layers of clay, sand,
and lignite. He was able to extract numerous fossil
plants, and thereby to determine the approximate age of
the beds.</p>

<p>Next he took up the exploration of ossiferous caves;
and he began this work with that of Brixham, in Windmill
Hill.</p>

<p>The floor of this cavern was excavated in successive
stages or layers, starting from the entrance. Bones
were found in the stalagmite and in the first, third, and
fourth beds, and worked flints in the third and fourth
beds only; but where the third bed filled the cavern up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to the rock, its upper portion contained neither bones
nor flints. The bones were those of the mammoth, the
rhinoceros, the urus, hyæna, cave lion and cave bear,
etc.</p>

<p>But by far the most laborious scientific undertaking
of Pengelly's life was the exploration of Kent's Cavern,
near Torquay. This cave was known as far back as
1824, when a Mr. Northmore, of Cleve, near Exeter,
made a superficial examination of it to ascertain
whether it had been a temple of Mithras, and quite
satisfied himself on this point. He was followed by
Sir W. C. Trevelyan and by the Rev. J. MacEnery.
But it was not till 1865 that a complete, scientific, and
exhaustive exploration was undertaken by the British
Association, which made a grant of £100 for the purpose.
Mr. Pengelly was appointed secretary and
reporter to the committee for the examination of the
cave and its deposits.</p>

<p>It was found that the floor of the cave exhibited the
following succession: (1) Blocks of limestone sometimes
large, clearly fallen from the roof. (2) A layer of
black mould ranging from a few inches to upwards
of a foot in depth. (3) Beneath this came a floor of
granular stalagmite, about a foot in thickness, formed
by the drip of water from the roof. (4) A red loam
containing a number of limestone fragments. (5) A
breccia of angular fragments of limestone and pebbles
and sandstone embedded in a reddish sandy
calcareous paste.</p>

<p>On June 19th, 1880, the exploration of Kent's Hole
was brought to an end. It was the most complete and
systematic investigation of a cavern that had ever been
undertaken, and on a much greater scale than that at
Brixham. A task of this kind is peculiarly exacting.
It cannot be entrusted to workmen; it cannot be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to a committee whose members pay but intermittent
visits: it demands the constant oversight of one man;
and this superintendence was given to Pengelly. The
total amount spent on this exploration was £2000.
Pengelly states in one of his papers that in the fifteen
and a quarter years during which the excavation was
in progress he visited Kent's Hole almost daily, and
spent over the work, on an average, five hours a day.</p>

<p>"Above the stalagmite, and principally in the black
mould, have been found a number of relics belonging
to different periods, such as socketed celts, and a
socketed knife of bronze, and some small fragments of
roughly smelted copper, about four hundred flint flakes,
cores, and chips, a polishing stone, a ring (made of Kimmeridge
clay), numerous spindle whorls, bone instruments
terminating in comb-like ends, pottery, marine
shells, numerous mammalian bones of existing species,
and some human bones, on which it has been thought
there are traces indicative of cannibalism. Some of
the pottery is distinctly Roman in character; but
many of the objects belong, no doubt, to pre-Roman
times."</p>

<p>What was found beneath the stalagmite belonged to
a long anterior period, where it had lain sealed up for,
at the very least, two thousand years. In this deposit
of the cave earth were found a large number of chips,
flakes, and implements of flint and chert, stones that
had served as pounders, and some pins, needles, and
harpoons of bone.</p>

<p>Some mammoth bones were found in Kent's Cavern,
and those of the cave lion, the sabre-toothed tiger, the
glutton, cave bear, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer,
and beaver.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Pengelly died on March 17th, 1894.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Transactions of the Devonshire Association</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for 1894 says: "For science he lived, and for
science he laboured, even long after the age when the
average man seeks rest and quiet. Starting out in
original lines of thought, and untrammelled by traditions
of years long ago, he met with many rebuffs,
and the conclusions which he derived from his investigations
and minute and patient inquiry were almost
laughed to scorn. But he adhered to his work and
clung to his beliefs, with enthusiastic devotion, and in
the end he lived to see even those who had originally
stoutly opposed his views convinced of their verity,
and their inestimable value to archæological and geological
science."</p>

<p>Pengelly himself left this piece of advice to the
student:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be careful in scientific inquiries that you get a
sufficient number of perfectly trustworthy facts; that
you interpret them with the aid of a rigorous logic;
that on suitable occasions you have courage enough to
avow your convictions; and don't be impatient, or annoyed,
if your friends don't receive all your conclusions,
or even if they call you bad names."</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Pengelly and Sir Charles
Lyell were those who startled English minds with the
revelation of the enormous period of time in which
man had lived on the earth, and of the slow progression
of man through vast ages in the development of
civilization. How that he began with the rudest flint
implements, and progressed but very slowly to the
perfection of these stone tools; how that only in comparatively
recent times did he discover the use of metals
and pottery; how of metals he first employed bronze,
and not till long after acquired the art of smelting iron
and fashioning tools and weapons of iron. All this
startled the world, and men were very unwilling to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the doctrine propounded and to acknowledge the facts
on which this doctrine was based.</p>

<p>The <i>Life of William Pengelly</i> was written by his
daughter Hester Pengelly, and published by Murray,
1897. Reference has been made as well to the obituary
notice in the <i>Transactions of the Devonshire Association</i>
for 1894.</p>

<h2>SIR CHARLES WILLS, K.B.</h2>


<p>Sir Charles Wills belonged to a very
ancient and widely ramified family in Cornwall.
The first, however, of whom anything
authentic is known was Anthony Wills, of
Saltash, who died in 1576. They were settled at Landrake,
at Morval, Botusfleming, Wyvelscombe, Exeter,
and Gorran.</p>

<p>Anthony Wills, of Gorran, youngest son of Digory
Wills, of Botusfleming, had a son, Anthony Wills,
who was the father of the Right Hon. Sir Charles
Wills, <span class="smcap">k.b.</span>, general of His Majesty's forces, baptized
at Gorran 23rd October, 1666. Sir Charles
had two brothers, Richard, of Acombe, in the county
of York, and Anthony, of the Inner Temple, who died
in Ireland 1689. The arms of the family are, <i>arg</i>. three
griffins passant, in pale, <i>sa.</i>, within a bordure engrailed
of the last <i>besantée</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was a subaltern in 1693, when serving in
the Low Countries under William III. The King
went to Holland at the end of March in that year, and
returned on the last day of October, when the armies
went into winter quarters. Wills was in the battle of
Landen and at the siege of Namur. On the 13th
October, 1705, he was appointed colonel of the 30th
Regiment, and sailed with it to Spain. He acted as
quartermaster-general to the troops in that country,
was present at Llenda, Almanza, and Saragossa, and
was made prisoner in 1711 with the army under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
General Stanhope, but was released at the end of the
war.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_036.png" id="i_036.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_036.png" alt="Lieutenant General Wills" title="Lieutenant General Wills" />
   <p class="caption2"><i>Lieutenant General Wills Commander of his Maj.<sup>ties</sup> Forces
in the Action against the Rebells at Preston in Lancashire.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He had been appointed brigadier-general in 1707,
major-general on 1st January, 1709, and lieutenant-general
16th November, 1710. After the peace of 1715,
being in command of the troops in the Midland district,
he marched northwards to meet the rebels from
Scotland, and he and General Carpenter met them at
Preston. Preston was a town both Jacobite and Roman
Catholic; and in it was the army of the Pretender,
composed of Scottish Highlanders and Lancashire
gentry and their retainers.</p>

<p>General Carpenter, who had been marching into
Scotland, turned back into Northumberland, and by
forced marches had reached Durham, where he combined
with General Wills, who had been sent some
time before into the north to quell the many riots that
preluded the insurrection.</p>

<p>Wills concentrated six regiments of cavalry, for the
most part newly raised, but commanded by experienced
officers, at Manchester, whence he moved to Wigan.
There it was arranged that Wills should march straight
upon Preston, while Carpenter, advancing in another
direction, should take the insurgents in flank. As the
Hanoverians approached, General Forster, who commanded
the Jacobites, gave satisfactory evidence that
he was no soldier; he fell into a fright and confusion,
and betook himself to bed. But Lord Kenmure roused
him, and in a hurried council, where all the gentlemen
had a voice, and where those spoke loudest who knew
least of war, a plan of defending Preston was adopted.
But the plan, at least as executed, consisted merely in
throwing up some barricades in the streets and in
posting some men in defence of them. Brigadier
Mackintosh either knew not the ground or his better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
judgment was overruled; for Preston offered many
advantages as a defensive position which were altogether
neglected. In front of the town was a bridge
over the Ribble, that might have been held by a handful
of men, and from the bridge to the town, for a
distance of a mile, the road ran through a hollow
between steep banks for a mile. But river, bridge, and
road were all left undefended. When Wills rode up
to the bridge and saw that it was unprotected he could
hardly believe his eyes; and then he concluded that
the insurgents must have abandoned Preston and begun
their retreat into Scotland, so that there would be no
fighting that day.</p>

<p>But as he came to the outskirts of the town, he heard
a tumultuous noise within, and saw the barricades that
Forster had thrown up, and was saluted by a shower
of bullets. He ordered his dragoons to dismount and
attack two of the barricades. This service was gallantly
performed; but the regulars were sorely galled by a fire
from the houses as well as from the barricades.</p>

<p>As night was falling Wills withdrew his men, after
they had suffered considerable loss. Early on the
following morning General Carpenter came up with a
part of his cavalry; and then Forster, who had
scarcely lost a man, and whose force more than doubled
that of the regular troops, lost heart entirely, and without
consulting his friends, sent Colonel Oxburgh to
propose a capitulation.</p>

<p>General Wills, irritated at the loss he had sustained
on the preceding evening, seemed at first disposed to
reject the proposition altogether; but at last he agreed
"that, if the rebels would lay down their arms and
surrender at discretion, he would protect them from
being cut to pieces by the soldiers, until further orders
from the Government."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>When Oxburgh's mission was known in the town,
and the result of it, the more warlike portion of the
insurgents were indignant and railed against the coward
Forster; and so incensed were they against him that,
according to an eye-witness, if he had ventured into
the street, he would infallibly have been torn to
pieces.</p>

<p>The brave Highlanders, seeing that nothing was to
be expected from the Lancastrian boors who had joined
them, proposed rushing with sword in hand and cutting
their way through the King's troops. But their leaders
thought this too hazardous a proceeding and counselled
surrender. They gave up Lord Derwentwater and
Colonel Mackintosh as hostages, and induced the clans
to lay down their arms and submit. Including English
and Scotch, only seventeen men had been killed in the
defence of Preston.</p>

<p>The Lancastrian peasants got away out of the town,
but fourteen hundred men were made prisoners by a
thousand, or at the outside twelve hundred English
horse. Among those captured were Lords Derwentwater,
Widdrington, Nithsdale, Winton, Carnwark,
Kenmure, Nairn, and Charles Murray. There were
others, members of ancient and honourable families of
the north, of Scotland, and of Lancashire.</p>

<p>The invasion of England by the Jacobites had thus
ended ingloriously. The noblemen and gentlemen of
rank and influence who were taken were sent to London
in charge of Brigadier Panter and a hundred men of
Lumley's Horse.</p>

<p>On January 5th, 1716, Wills was appointed to the
colonelcy of the 3rd Regiment of the line, and on the
death of Lord Cadogan was transferred in August,
1726, to that of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards.</p>

<p>It was customary at all times for the King's company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of the 1st Guards to fly the Royal Standard,
which was carried by that company on all state occasions.
It was of crimson silk throughout, with the
King's cypher and crown in the middle and the arms
of the three kingdoms quartered in the four corners.
The staff of this standard was also more ornamented
than that of the other twenty-seven companies. The
lieutenant-colonel's colours were also of crimson silk
throughout. These colours were renewed every seven
years.</p>

<p>In 1723 the King went to Hanover, when a camp
was formed in Hyde Park under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Wills. He had been elected M.P. for
Totnes in 1714, and he represented that borough till
1741. In 1725 he was made Knight of the Bath and
Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>In 1733, in consequence of the increase of smuggling
carried on even in London, Strickland, Secretary for
War, addressed a letter in the form of a warrant to the
Governor of the Tower and to the officers in command
of the Guards, authorizing them to furnish detachments
of men to assist in securing contraband goods; and
in consequence of the increase of the duties to be performed
by the men of the Foot Guards, their establishment
was raised in 1739 by ten men per company.</p>

<p>In 1740, as the political horizon on the Continent
was threatening, Walpole had to choose between declaring
war with Spain and resigning. He disapproved
of war, but rather than resign declared it. The people
of London were delighted and rang the bells in the
steeples. "Ah!" said Walpole; "they are ringing
the bells now; they soon will be wringing their hands."
Camps, in anticipation of hostilities, were ordered to
be formed in various parts of England. In March
orders were conveyed to Sir Charles Wills and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to direct their officers to provide themselves with tents
and everything needful for encamping, and those troops
under Sir Charles were to occupy Hounslow. He
superintended the formation of the camp where the
whole of the Horse and Foot Guards were to assemble,
and previous to departing they paraded in Hyde Park,
on June 15th, under Sir Charles, who had a lieutenant-general
and a major-general on the staff with him.
Thence he proceeded to the encampment on the Heath
marked out for the purpose.</p>

<p>The twenty-four companies of the 1st Guards under
the command of Colonel Richard Ingoldsby, second
major of the regiment, remained encamped on Hounslow
from June 16th for several months&mdash;in fact, till the
middle of October.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wills was now filling the post of General
Commander of the King's forces, but had been failing
in health and strength, and soon became quite unable
to take any active work; and he died on December 25th,
Christmas Day, 1741, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>He had never been married. He had purchased land
at Claxton, and this and all he had he bequeathed to
Field-Marshal Sir Robert Rich, Bart., of Roxhill, in
Suffolk, Governor of Chelsea Hospital.</p>

<h2>LIEUTENANT GOLDSMITH AND THE
LOGAN ROCK</h2>


<p>In the parish of S. Levan is a promontory running
out into the sea, once cut off by embankments
on the land side, and converted into a cliff castle,
that bears the name of Trereen-Dinas. The
headland presents a succession of natural piles of
granite tors, the first of which, rising perpendicularly,
is crowned by the far-famed Logan Rock, a mass weighing
about ninety tons, and so exactly poised upon one
point that any one, by applying his shoulder to it,
could make the whole mass rock sensibly. Not only
so, but in a high wind it could be seen rolling on its
pivot.</p>

<p>Doctor Borlase, in his <i>Antiquities of Cornwall</i>, 1754,
says: "In the parish of S. Levan, Cornwall, there is
a promontory called Castle Treryn. This cape consists
of three distinct groupes of rocks. On the
western side of the middle groupe, near the top, lies
a very large stone, so evenly poised, that any hand may
move it to and fro; but the extremities of its base are
at such a distance from each other, and so well secured
by their nearness to the stone which it stretches itself
upon, that it is morally impossible that any lever, or
indeed force (however applied in a mechanical way),
can remove it from its present situation."</p>

<p>This overbold statement, added to the persistence of
the people of the neighbourhood, that no man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
throw the Logan Rock from its balance, stirred up
a silly young lieutenant, Hugh Colvill Goldsmith, of
H.M.S. cutter <i>Nimble</i>, on the preventive service, lying
off the Land's End on the look-out for smugglers, to
attempt to do what the popular voice declared to be
impossible. Lieut. Goldsmith was a nephew of the
famous Oliver Goldsmith, and had consequently some
flighty Irish blood in his veins.</p>

   <p class="caption2">A VIEW OF THE CELEBRATED LOGAN ROCK, NEAR LAND'S END IN CORNWALL<br />
<i>Taken after the Rock was displaced on the 8th of April</i>, 1824</p>
</div>

<p>"On April 8, 1824," says the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
"a party of sailors belonging to H.M. cutter <i>Nimble</i>,
commanded by Lieut. Goldsmith, came on shore
for the purpose of removing from its situation that
great curiosity the Logging (rocking) Stone; and
which object they were unfortunately enabled to accomplish.
This mass of granite, which is nearly 100
tons weight, was one of the three objects that excited
the curiosity of every visitor to the west part of Cornwall.
It stood on the summit of a mass of rocks at the
Land's End, and was so poised on a natural pivot, that
the force which a man could exert was sufficient to
cause it to vibrate. In this situation it remained from
a period anterior to our authentic records, as it is
noticed by our earliest writers, until the <i>barbarian</i>
above mentioned, in sheer wantonness, removed it
from its place. This act of vandalism has excited the
greatest indignation at Penzance, as it will in every
part of Cornwall, and throughout the kingdom. It
appears that Lieut. Goldsmith landed at the head
of fourteen of his men, and with the assistance of handspikes
and a handscrew, called by the sailors jack-in-the-box,
with much labour and perseverance threw
over the stone. What renders the act most atrocious
is, that two poor families, who derived a subsistence
from attending visitors to the stone, are now deprived
of the means of support."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>It was found that the handspikes and jack were of no
avail. Accordingly Goldsmith made his fourteen men
put their shoulders to the stone and bring it into such
violent oscillation that at last it toppled over.</p>

<p>The Logan Stone, thus displaced, would have rolled
down from the tor on which it had rested and have shot
into the sea, had it not happily been arrested by a cleft
in the rock.</p>

<p>The indignation of the people was great, so that the
life of Lieut. Goldsmith was threatened by the sturdy
fishermen, should he land. But the desire to land
was taken from him, for the whole county was roused,
and a gathering of the magistrates was summoned to
consider what could be done, and to memorialize the
Admiralty against the perpetrator of this wanton act
of mischief.</p>

<p>Happily Mr. Davies Gilbert was at the time in
London, and he at once proceeded to the Admiralty
and complained of the vandalism perpetrated, and requested
that the lieutenant should be ordered to replace
the block as found, and that the proper apparatus,
capstan, blocks, chains, etc., should be furnished by
the dockyard at Devonport.</p>

<p>This was undertaken, and orders were despatched to
Lieut. Goldsmith that he must either restore the Logan
Rock to its old position, at his own cost, or forfeit his
commission. As the expense would be wholly beyond
his means, Mr. Davies Gilbert very liberally subscribed
£150 for the purpose.</p>

<p>A writer, Lieut. L. Edye, in the <i>Western Antiquary</i>
for 1887, says: "In his trouble he appealed to
my grandfather (Mr. William Edye) for advice and
assistance, stating that the Admiralty had called upon
him either to replace the stone or forfeit his commission.
My grandfather, ever ready to render assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to any one in trouble, readily assisted, and having
travelled into Cornwall (as a friend) and seen the
damage done, applied to the Admiralty for the loan
of plant and men. Their Lordships complied with the
request, but stipulated that the cost must be entirely
defrayed by Lieut. Goldsmith."</p>

<p>We will now see what Goldsmith had to say for
himself. The following is an extract from a letter
written by him to his mother, dated April 24th,
1824:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The facts in question, my dear mother, are these:
On the 8th of this month we were off the Land's End,
near the spot where the Rock stood. Our boats were
creeping along shore beneath it for some goods which,
we suspected, might be sunk in the sands near it. I
took the opportunity of landing to look at the Logan
Rock with my mate; and hearing that it was not in
the power of men to remove it, I took it into my head
to try my skill, and, at this time (half-past four o'clock
p.m.), the boats having finished what they had to do,
and it blowing too fresh for them to creep any longer,
I took them and their crew with me, and, having landed
at the foot of the rocks, we all scrambled up the precipice.
We had with us, at first, three handspikes, with
which we tried to move the Rock, but could not do it."
By move the rock he really means&mdash;displace it. A
child could move it on its pivot. "The handspikes
were then laid aside, and the nine men who were with
me took hold of the Rock by the edge, and with great
difficulty set it in a rocking motion, which became so
great, that I was fearful of bidding them try to stop it
lest it should fall back upon us, and away it went unfortunately,
clean over upon its side, where it now
rests. There was not an instrument of any kind or
description near the Rock when thrown over, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
one handspike, and that I held in my hand, but which
was of no use in upsetting the Rock; and this is the
truth, and nothing but the truth, as I hope for salvation.</p>

<p>"For my part, I had no intention, or the most
distant thought, of doing mischief, even had I thrown
the Rock into the sea. I was innocently, as my God
knows, employed, as far as any bad design about me.
I knew not that the Rock was so idolized in this neighbourhood,
and you may imagine my astonishment
when I found all Penzance in an uproar. I was to be
transported at least; the newspapers have traduced me,
and made me worse than a murderer, and the base
falsehoods in them are more than wicked. But here I
am, my dear mother, still holding up my head, boldly
conscious of having only committed an act of inadvertency.
Be not uneasy&mdash;my character is yet safe;
and you have nothing on that score to make you
uneasy. I have many friends in Penzance: among
them the persons most interested in the Rock, and
many who were most violent now see the thing in its
true light. I intend putting the bauble in its place
again, and hope to get as much credit as I have anger
for throwing it down."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

   <p class="caption2">A VIEW OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF CASTLE TRERYN, SHEWING THE MACHINERY ERECTED FOR THE
PURPOSE OF REPLACING THE LOGAN ROCK</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is disingenuous, and is the composition
of a man impudent and conceited. He knew the
estimation in which the Logan Rock was held, and it
was because Borlase had pronounced it impossible of
displacement that he resolved to displace it. He pretends
that he tried to "move" it, whereas from the
context it is clear that he intended to throw it down,
and for this purpose had brought the handspikes. He
boasts vaingloriously of his intention of replacing it
and gaining glory thereby, and never says a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
about his having been given by the Admiralty the
alternative of doing that or losing his commission.
Nor does he mention the generous help he received from
Mr. Gilbert and his kinsman Mr. Edye.</p>

<p>On November 2nd, in the presence of vast crowds,
ladies waving their handkerchiefs, and men firing <i>feux
de joie</i>, the block was raised, Mr. Goldsmith, his
natural conceit overcoming his sense of vexation,
superintending the operation. But, although replaced,
it was no longer so perfectly balanced as before. As
one wrote who was present at the time, "it rocked
differently, though well enough to satisfy the people."</p>

<p>An account of the feat, written in the true style of
the penny-a-liner, appeared in the <i>Royal Cornwall
Gazette</i> of the 6th November:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Logan Rock is in its place, and <i>logs</i> again.
Lieut. Goldsmith has nobly repaired the error of a
moment by a long trial of skill and energy and
courage. I say courage, for it was a work of great
peril; and wherever danger was, there he was always
foremost&mdash;under the weight of the mass of machinery,
and on the edge of the precipice.... I shall content
myself with barely observing, as a proof of the skill
of applying the complicated machinery employed, that
many engineers had their doubts whether it could be so
applied, and even when erected, they doubted whether
it would be efficient.</p>

<p>"The moment, therefore (on Friday last), when the
men took their stations at the capstans was an anxious
one, and when, after twenty minutes' toil, Lieut.
Goldsmith announced from the stage, 'It moves, thank
God!' a shout of applause burst from all who beheld
it. Endeavour to conceive a group of rocks of the
most grand and romantic appearance, forming an
amphitheatre, with multitudes seated on the irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
masses, or clinging to its precipices: conceive a huge
platform carried across an abyss from rock to rock, and
upon it three capstans manned by British seamen.
Imagine the lofty masts which are seen rearing their
heads, from which ropes are connected with chains in
many a fold and of massive strength. A flag waves
over all: the huge stone is in the midst. Every eye
is directed to the monstrous bulk. Will it break its
chains? Will it fall and spread ruin? Or will it defy
the power that attempts to stir it? Will all the skill
and energy, and strength and hardihood, have been
exerted in vain? We shall soon know: expectation
sits breathless; and at last it moves.</p>

<p>"All's well. Such was the first half-hour. In two
hours it was suspended in the air, and vibrated;
but art was triumphant, and held the huge leviathan
fast.</p>

<p>"I will not detail the labour of two successive days;
but come to the last moment. At twenty minutes past
four on Tuesday afternoon a signal was given that the
rock was in its place and that it logged again. This
was announced by a spectator. But where was Lieut.
Goldsmith? Why does not he announce it? He has
called his men around him: his own and their hats are
off: he is addressing them first, and calling upon them
to return thanks to God, through whose aid alone
the work had been done&mdash;a work of great peril and
hazard&mdash;and by His blessing without loss of life or
limb.</p>

<p>"After this appropriate and solemn act, he called
upon them to join in the British sailors' testimony of joy,
three cheers; and then turned with all his gallant men
to receive the re-echoing cheers of the assembled multitude.
That Lieut. Goldsmith, whose character&mdash;like
the rock&mdash;is replaced on a firm basis, may have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
opportunity of exerting his great talents and brave
spirit in the service of his profession, is the sincere
wish of all this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>Lieut. L. Edye, in his communication to the <i>Western
Antiquary</i> above quoted, says: "The result of this
foolhardy act was that Lieut. Goldsmith was pecuniarily
ruined, whilst the natives of the locality reaped a rich
harvest by pointing out the fallen stone to visitors."</p>

<p>The Cornish are a forgiving people, and it was
actually proposed after the re-erection of the stone to
give to Lieut. Goldsmith a dinner and a silver cup.</p>

<p>Lieut. Hugh Colvill Goldsmith had been born at
St. Andrew's, New Brunswick, 2nd April, 1789, so
that he was aged thirty-five when he performed this
prank. He died at sea off S. Thomas, in the West
Indies, 8th October, 1841, without having obtained
advancement.</p>

<h2>HUGH PETERS, THE REGICIDE</h2>


<p>The life and character of this man present
unusual difficulties. On one side he was
unduly lauded, he was represented, especially
by himself, as a paragon of all
virtues; on the other he was decried with virulence,
his past life raked over, and every scandal brought to
the surface and exposed to public view, and we cannot
be at all sure that all these scandals laid to his charge
were true.</p>

<p>We do not know much about his origin, and why he
was named Peters; he was the son of a Thomas Dickwood,
<i>alias</i> Peters, and Martha, daughter of John
Treffry of Treffry. This Dickwood, <i>alias</i> Peters, is
said to have been a merchant of Fowey, descended
from Dutch ancestors who had escaped from Antwerp
for their adherence to the Reformed religion; and
Hugh Peters was born in 1599. But Dickwood is
not a Flemish or Dutch name. Henry Peters, M.P.
for Fowey, who died in 1619, married Deborah,
daughter of John Treffry of Place, in 1610, and had
one son, Thomas, who was thrown into prison by
Cromwell for his loyalty to King Charles. Neither
Hugh Peters nor his father with the <i>alias</i> appears
in the well-authenticated pedigree of the family of
Peters of Harlyn. It may be suspected that the father
of Hugh Peters was a bastard of one of the Peters
family.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Hugh Peters was sent to Trinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
College, Cambridge, at the age of fourteen&mdash;his elder
brother at the time was a student at Oxford&mdash;and he
took his degree of B.A. in 1616. For a time he led a
rather wild life and joined a party of comedians.
Dr. William Yonge says that "he joined a common
society of players: when, after venting his frothy inventions,
he had a greater call to a higher promotion,
namely, to be a jester, or rather a fool, in Shakespeare's
Company of Players." Shakespeare died in 1616, so
this must have been his company continuing to bear
his name. He, however, became converted by a sermon
he heard at S. Faith's, and "deserted his companions
and employments, and returning to his
chamber near Fleet Conduit, continued between hope
and despair a year or more."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/i_056.png" alt="HUGH PETERS" title="HUGH PETERS" />
   <p class="caption2">HUGH PETERS<br />
<i>From an old engraving</i></p>
</div>

<p>He was ordained deacon 23rd December, 1621, and
priest 8th June, 1623, by Mountain, Bishop of London,
and took his M.A. degree in 1622. He was licensed
to preach at S. Sepulchre's. He says of himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Sepulchre's I was brought by a very strange
providence; for preaching before at another place, and
a young man receiving some good, would not be satisfied,
but I must preach at Sepulchre's, once monthly,
for the good of his friends, in which he got his end
(if I might not show vanity), and he allowed thirty
pounds per <i>ann.</i> to that lecture, but his person unknown
to me. He was a chandler, and died a good
man, and Member of Parliament. At this lecture the
resort grew so great, that it contracted envy and anger;
though I believe above a hundred every week were
persuaded from sin to Christ; there were six or seven
thousand hearers, and the circumstances fit for such
good work."</p>

<p>How six or seven thousand persons could be got
into St. Sepulchre's Church passes one's comprehension.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
According to his own account, he got into
trouble through Nonconformity. Ludlow, in his
<i>Memoirs</i>, says that Peters "had been a minister in
England for many years, till he was forced to leave his
native country by the persecution set on foot, in the
time of Archbishop Laud, against all those who refused
to comply with the innovations and superstitions
which were then introduced into the public
worship."</p>

<p>There is, however, another and less creditable
explanation. He is said to have become entangled in
an intrigue with a butcher's wife. But how far this is
true, and whether it be malicious scandal, we have no
means of judging.</p>

<p>He had, however, married the widow of Edmund
Read, of Wickford, Essex, and mother of Colonel
Thomas Read, afterwards Governor of Stirling, and a
partisan of Monk at the Restoration. Mrs. Edmund
Read also had a daughter, Elizabeth, who in 1635
married the younger Winthrop, Governor of Connecticut.</p>

<p>From London Peters went to Rotterdam, where, if
Yonge may be trusted, he paid such court to and
attempted such familiarities with a Mrs. Franklyn, that
she complained to her husband, whereupon Mr. Franklyn
"entertains Peters with crab-tree sauce."</p>

<p>At Rotterdam he became preacher in the English
chapel. What had become of his wife, whether she
remained in England or accompanied him to Holland,
we are not informed.</p>

<p>It will be well here to say a few words on the condition
of religion in England at the time.</p>

<p>The plan of Henry VIII had been to make the
Church of England independent of the Pope, but to
remain Catholic. At his death the Protector and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Duke of Northumberland, after the fall of Somerset,
had encouraged the ultra-Protestants. The churches
had been plundered, chantries and colleges robbed, the
Mass interdicted, and the wildest fanaticism encouraged.
As Froude says: "Three-quarters of the English
people were Catholics; that is, they were attached to
the hereditary and traditionary doctrines of the Church.
They detested, as cordially as the Protestants, the
interference of a foreign power, whether secular or
spiritual, with English liberty."</p>

<p>A more disgraceful page of history has never been
written than that regarding the two protectorates during
the minority of Edward VI. The currency was debased,
peculation was rife. "Amidst the wreck of
ancient institutions," says Froude, "the misery of the
people, and the moral and social anarchy by which the
nation was disintegrated, thoughtful persons in England
could not fail to be asking themselves what they had
gained by the Reformation.</p>

<p>"The movement commenced by Henry VIII, judged
by its present results, had brought the country at last
into the hands of mere adventurers. The people had
exchanged a superstition which, in its grossest abuses,
prescribed some shadow of respect for obedience, for
a superstition which merged obedience in speculative
belief; and under that baneful influence, not only the
higher virtues of self-sacrifice, but the commonest
duties of probity and morality, were disappearing.
Private life was infected with impurity to which the
licentiousness of the Catholic clergy appeared like
innocence. The Government was corrupt, the courts of
law were venal. The trading classes cared only to
grow rich. The multitude were mutineers from oppression.... The
better order of commonplace men, who
had a conscience, but no special depth of insight&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
had small sense of spiritual things, but a strong
perception of human rascality&mdash;looked on in a stern and
growing indignation, and, judging the tree by its fruits,
waited their opportunity for action."</p>

<p>When Mary came to the throne there was an
immense outburst of enthusiasm, the time of the Protestant
protectorates was looked back on as a bad dream.
In spite of the fact that England was under an interdict,
the Mass was restored, and no rector or vicar cared
a straw for the Papal bull, nor indeed did Mary, who
heard Mass in the chapel of the Tower, and afterwards
in S. Paul's.</p>

<p>If Mary had only accepted the advice tendered to her
by Charles V, she would have reigned as a popular
monarch, and have settled the condition of the Church
of England on lines that commended themselves to
nobles, commons, and clergy alike, Catholic but not
Papal. But she had looked too long to the see of Peter
as her support, and she managed completely to alienate
the affections of her people. The fires of Smithfield
brought the fanatics who had been discredited in the
former reign into favour once more; and when Elizabeth
came to the throne, and had been deposed by Pope
Pius V, and her subjects released from allegiance to
her, and plots formed for her assassination, under favour
of the Pope, the religious sentiment in England was cleft
as with a hatchet&mdash;some who loved the religion of their
fathers were constrained against their will and consciences
to become Papists, and others became wild and
reckless fanatics in a Puritan direction. Between these
two parties sat the vast bulk of the English people,
looking this way, that way, and deeming all religion
foolishness, and self-interest the only thing to be sought
after. All the foundations of the religious world were
out of course. The <i>via media</i> is all very well in theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and when well trodden, but when it is experimental,
and one road to the right leads to Rome and that to
the left to Geneva, the <i>via media</i> may be taken to lead
nowhere, and those who tread it have to do so uncertainly.
A session between two stools is precarious,
and the Church of England had been forced by the
folly of Mary to adopt this position. The consequence
was that in the reigns of Elizabeth and James and
Charles I there was no enthusiasm in the clergy of the
Church. The bishops were grasping, self-seeking
worldlings. Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury,
was the best among an ignoble crew. When he
died, says Froude, "he left behind him enormous
wealth, which had been accumulated, as is proved from
a statement in the handwriting of his successor, by the
same unscrupulous practices which had brought about
the first revolt against the Church. No Catholic
prelate in the old easy times had so flagrantly abused
the dispensation system. Every year he made profits
by admitting children to the cure of souls, for money.
He used a graduated scale in which the price for inducting
an infant into a benefice varied with the age, children
under fourteen not being inadmissible, if the adequate
fees were forthcoming."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The great majority of the nobility and gentry of
England clung to the doctrine and ceremonies of the
ancient Church, and yet were united in determination
to oppose the Papal claims. Benefices in their presentation
were held by priests who said the Communion
Service, which was but the Mass in English, with the
ancient vestments and ritual; and others, next door,
were held by men who could hardly be compelled to
wear even the surplice, and who celebrated the Eucharist
but once in the year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>The Church was a hodgepodge of conflicting doctrines
and ceremonial. As Froude says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So long as a single turn of the wheel, a violent
revolution, or the Queen's death, might place a Catholic
(Papist) on the throne, the Established Church held a
merely conditional existence. It had no root in the
nation, for every earnest man who was not a Puritan
was a Catholic; and its officers, for the most part,
regarded their tenures as an opportunity for enriching
themselves, which would probably be short, and should
in prudence be made use of while it remained. Benefices
were appropriated to laymen, sold, or accumulated
upon favourites. Churches in many places were left
unserved, and cobblers and tailors were voted by the
congregations into the pulpits. 'The bishops,' said
Cecil, 'had no credit either for learning, good living,
or hospitality.' The Archbishop of York had scandalized
his province by being found in bed with the wife
of an innkeeper at Doncaster. Other prelates had
bestowed ordination 'on men of lewd life and corrupt
behaviour.' The Bishop of Lichfield had made seventy
'lewd and unlearned ministers, for money,' in one
day."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Barlow, of S. David's, had torn the lead roof
off his palace and the castle at Lawhadden to provide
dowers for his daughters, and would have unroofed his
cathedral had he not been prevented by Elizabeth, because
in it was the monument of Edmund, Earl of
Richmond, the father of Henry VII. When translated
to Bath and Wells he destroyed the lady chapel, the
finest Perpendicular building in the West of England,
surpassing even Sherborne and Bath, and sold it&mdash;lead,
roof, stones, and all. Some of the clergy were mere
temporizers, without convictions, taking their colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
from their patrons, and ready to believe or pretend to
believe this or that, as suited their pockets. The
majority were indifferent&mdash;ignorant&mdash;not knowing
where they stood. Many had thrust their way into
Holy Orders for the sake of the loaves and fishes that
might be obtained in the Established Church, with no
work to do, without education, without zeal, without
convictions, and consequently totally without the least
enthusiasm, without any fixed principles.</p>

<p>Laud and the Star Chamber sought to produce conformity
by cutting off ears and slitting noses. But
what Laud failed to see was that the only men in religious
England who knew their minds, who had any
fixed principles in religion, were the Papists and the
Puritans. What they should have done, but what
probably they could not do, was to inspire the clergy of
the Church with zeal and enthusiasm. But the clergy
could not catch the fire from off the altar; they had
entered Orders for the sake of a rectory, a glebe and
tithe, and cared for nothing else. If one half&mdash;nay,
one quarter&mdash;of the charges brought against them by
the Tryers be true, they were a most unworthy set. In
Elizabeth's reign there had been a difficulty in filling
the benefices, and any Jack and Tom who could gratify
the bishop and could read was ordained and appointed
to a benefice. And these were the men to maintain the
doctrine of the Universal Church and Apostolic tradition
against fiery enthusiasts on one side who took
their own reading of Scripture for divine inspiration,
and on the other against the Papists who set their back
against the Rock of Peter.</p>

<p>With churches picked bare, with sermons without fire,
services performed without dignity, often with indecorum,
without religious instruction from teachers who
did not know what to teach, it is no wonder that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
people turned away to hot-gospellers and tub-thumpers
who, if they could not kindle in them love and charity,
could set them on fire with self-righteousness and religious
animosities.</p>

<p>At Rotterdam Peters threw over creed and liturgy
of the Church of England, and leaving the English
chapel, became co-pastor with Dr. William Ames of an
Independent meeting-house at Rotterdam, and Ames
died there in his arms. In Holland Peters made the
acquaintance of John Forbes, Professor of Divinity in
the University of Aberdeen, a great Hebraist. In
a pamphlet published by Peters in 1646 he says:
"I lived about six years near that famous Scotsman,
Mr. John Forbes, with whom I travelled into Germany,
and enjoyed his society in much love and sweetness
constantly; from whom I received nothing but encouragement,
though we differed in the way of our
'churches.'"</p>

<p>After Peters had spent six years in the United Provinces,
he suddenly threw up his pastoral charge and
departed for New England, with five hundred pounds
in his pocket, which his friends furnished, and a young
waiting-maid, Mary Morell, whom he shortly after
married to one Peter Folger.</p>

<p>"In this year (1635)," says one account, "came over
that famous servant of Christ, Mr. Hugh Peters. He
was called to office by the Church of Christ at Salem,
their former pastor, the Rev. Mr. Higginson, having
ended his labours resting in the Lord."</p>

<p>Salem had been planted but a few years before, the
first colonists in Massachusetts having settled there in
1628. Here he remained for over seven years, combining
his duties as a minister of religion and trading,
so that he was spoken of as "the father of our commerce
and the founder of our trade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>He was also a militant Christian, and was present in
the fighting against the Pequot Indians. Concerning
the prisoners taken, Hugh Peters wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Endicott and myself salute you in the
Lord Jesus, etc. [<i>sic</i>]. We have heard of a divisioning
of women and children in the Bay, and would be
glad of a share, viz. a young woman or girl, and a boy
if you think good. I wrote to you for some boys to
Bermuda.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Hugh Peters.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>These prisoners were used as slaves, and sold just
as were the negroes later. Peters, we are informed,
was not friendly to the notion of converting the
Indians to Christianity. He would entertain compunction
about enslaving them should they embrace the
gospel. However, money was sent over from England
for this purpose, and&mdash;at the suggestion of Peters.
In the <i>Colonial State Papers</i> (Saintsbury, America and
West Indies, 1661-8, p. 86), is this passage: "Through
the motion of Hugh Peters, England contributed nine
hundred pounds per annum to Christianize the Indians
of New England; which money found its way into
private men's purses, and was a cheat of Hugh
Peters."</p>

<p>In New England Peters married a second wife,
in 1639, another widow, by name Deliverance Sheffield.</p>

<p>In 1641 he left for England, deputed by the colony
to act as ambassador at the Court of Charles I, to
endeavour to procure some mitigation of the excise
and customs duties, which weighed heavily on the
colonists.</p>

<p>But on reaching England he found that the Crown
and the Parliament were at variance, and he did not
care to return to America and to his wife whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
left there, but elected to be the stormy petrel of the
rebellion, flying over the land, and, as Ludlow says,
advising the people everywhere to take arms in the
cause of the Parliament.</p>

<p>He was appointed chaplain to a brigade of troops
sent into Ireland against the rebels, and he had no
hesitation in wielding the sword as well as the tongue,
the latter to animate the soldiers, the former to extirpate
the Baal-worshippers.</p>

<p>Then he hastened to Holland, where he collected
thirty thousand pounds for the relief of the Protestants
of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who had been plundered and burnt out of
their homes by the rebels.</p>

<p>When Peters had effected his various purposes in
Ireland, he returned to England, and made his report
of the condition of affairs there to Sir Thomas Fairfax
and Cromwell.</p>

<p>In 1643 he was appointed, or thrust himself forward,
to minister to Chaloner on the scaffold, as that man
had been condemned to death for participation in
Waller's plot. So again in 1644 he was on the scaffold
haranguing and praying for and at Sir John
Hotham, who probably would have preferred to die in
quiet.</p>

<p>Peters was now engaged as chaplain to the Parliamentary
forces, and especially as a conveyer of
despatches, for all which he received liberal payment.
He was with the Earl of Warwick at the taking of
Lyme, and was despatched by that nobleman to
London to give an account of the affair in Parliament.
On another occasion he was entrusted with
letters from Sir Thomas Fairfax relating to the capture
of Bridgwater, on which occasion he was voted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a sum of £100. In the same year, 1645, he was
commissioned by Sir Thomas to report the taking
of Bristol. In March of that year Hugh Peters was
with the army in Cornwall, and harangued at Bodmin
against the Crown and the Church, and exhorted all
good men and true to adhere to the cause of the Parliament.</p>

<p>Peters had uniformly, since he had been in the
Low Countries, postured as an Independent hot and
strong. Hitherto the Presbyterians had the prevailing
party in Parliament, and among the discontents in the
country, but now the Independents began to assert
themselves and assume predominance. Their numbers
were greatly increased by the return of the more fiery
spirits who had, like Peters, abandoned England
during the supremacy of Laud. Many of these, coming
back from New England, had carried the doctrines of
Puritanism to the very verge of extravagance, and not
the least fiery and extravagant of these was Hugh
Peters. These men rejected all ecclesiastical establishments,
would admit of no spiritual authority in one
man above another, and allowed of no interposition of
the magistrate in religious matters. Each congregation,
voluntarily united, was an integral and independent
church, to exercise its own jurisdiction. The
political system of the Independents was one of pure
republicanism. They aspired to a total abolition of
monarchy, even of the aristocracy, and projected a
commonwealth in which all men should be equal.
Sir Harry Vane, Oliver Cromwell, Nathaniel Fiennes,
and Oliver St. John, the Solicitor-General, were regarded
as their leaders, and Hugh Peters as their
prophet.</p>

<p>Peters brought the news to Parliament of the capture
of Winchester Castle, for which service he was paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
£50. When Dartmouth was taken, he hastened thence
to London, laden with crucifixes, vestments, papers, and
sundry church ornaments, of which he had despoiled
the beautiful church of S. Saviour's; and received
in recompense from the Parliament an estate of which
the House had deprived Lord Craven.</p>

<p>When the city of Worcester was besieged in the
year 1646 by the Parliamentary forces, the governor
consented to surrender on condition that passes were
given to the soldiers and to the principal inhabitants.
Peters negotiated the surrender.</p>

<p>A Mr. Habingdon, who wrote an account of the siege
at the time, and who died in the ensuing year, relates
that on the 23rd July, 1646, many gentlemen went to
six o'clock prayers at the cathedral to take the last sad
farewell of the church services, the organs having
been removed three days before, and that at ten o'clock
in the morning the several regiments marched forth,
and all the gentlemen with the baggage; and that at
one o'clock Peters brought them their passes, and importuned
every one individually to pass his word not
again to bear arms against the Parliament.</p>

<p>Hugh Peters was now such a favourite with the
Parliament that they made an order for £100 a year to
himself and his heirs for ever; later an additional
£200 per annum was voted to him, and all this in addition
to his pay as preacher, and to sundry grants as
bearer of news from the army. He was also accorded
Archbishop Laud's library. Nevertheless, as
he lamented in his <i>Legacy of a Dying Father</i>, he found
it impossible to keep out of debt.</p>

<p>There is this in Peters' favour to be urged, that he
opposed the execution of Archbishop Laud, and urged
that instead he should be sent to New England. So
he begged the life of Lord George Goring, Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Norwich, and of the Marquis of Hamilton, and again
of the Marquis of Worcester.</p>

<p>The Presbyterians were in force in the House of
Commons, but the army was composed mainly of Independents,
worked up to enthusiasm by their preachers.
It had been six months in the field in the summer of
1648, engaged against the Cavaliers and Scots. The
soldiers were thoroughly incensed against the King,
and they had no respect for the Presbyterians. Their
officers resolved on assuming the sovereign power in
their own hands, and bringing the King to justice, and
converting the Government into a commonwealth.</p>

<p>To accomplish this they presented a remonstrance to
the Parliament by six of their council on November
20th, demanding: (1) that the King be brought to trial
for high treason; (2) that a day be set for the Prince
of Wales and the Duke of York to surrender themselves,
or to be declared incapable of government, and
that in future no king should be admitted but by the
free election of the people.</p>

<p>The Commons were struck with dismay, and deferred
debate on the remonstrance for ten days. But the
officers despatched Colonel Ewes to the Isle of Wight
with a party of horse to secure the King's person, and
to bring him to Windsor, in order to his trial. The
officers then, on November 30th, sent a declaration to
the House to enforce their late remonstrance, and requiring
the majority in the House to exclude from
their councils such as would obstruct the King's trial.</p>

<p>On December 2nd Fairfax arrived in London at the
head of the army, and the House of Commons found
itself cornered by the armed force. Nevertheless, they
had the courage to vote that the seizure of the King,
and the conveying him a prisoner to Hurst Castle, had
been done without their advice and consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers were resolved to carry their point. A
regiment of horse and another of foot were placed at
the door of the Parliament House, and Colonel Pride
entered and took into custody about forty of the members
who were disposed to obstruct the cause the army
sought to pursue, and denied entrance to about a hundred
more; others were ordered to leave; and the number
of those present was thus thinned down to a
hundred and fifty or two hundred, most of them officers
of the army.</p>

<p>The secluded members published a protestation
against all these proceedings as null and void till they
were restored to their places; but the Lords and
Commons who remained in the House voted their
protestation false, scandalous, and seditious.</p>

<p>The army, having vanquished all opposition, went
on to change the whole form of government; and to
make way for it determined to impeach the King of
high treason, as having been the cause of all the blood
that had been spilt in the late war.</p>

<p>There was commotion in the House and in town and
the country. In the House some declared that there
was no need to bring the King to trial; others said
that there existed no law by which he could be tried;
but all this was overruled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hugh Peters was not idle. In a sermon
addressed to the members of the two Houses a few
days before the King's trial he said: "My Lords, and
you noble Gentlemen,&mdash;It is you we chiefly look
for justice from. Do you prefer the great Barabbas,
Murderer, Tyrant, and Traitor, before these poor hearts
(pointing to the red coats) and the army who are our
saviour?"</p>

<p>In another sermon before Cromwell and Bradshaw
he said: "There is a great discourse and talk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
world, What, will ye cut off the head of a Protestant
Prince? Turn to your Bibles, and ye shall find it
there, Whosoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his
blood be shed. I see neither King Charles, Prince
Charles, Prince Rupert, nor Prince Maurice, nor any
of that rabble excepted out of it."</p>

<p>Evelyn in his <i>Diary</i>, under date 17th January,
1648-9, says: "I heard the rebel Peters invite the
rebel powers met in the Painted Chamber to destroy
his Majesty." Bishop Burnet says: "That he (Peters)
had been outrageous in pressing the King's death with
the cruelty and rudeness of an inquisitor."</p>

<p>Prynne, one of the secluded members, published
"A brief memento to the present unparliamentary
junto, touching their present intentions and proceedings
to depose and execute Charles Stuart, their lawful King
of England."</p>

<p>The officers now decided to gain the approval of the
ministers&mdash;Presbyterian&mdash;in London, or at least persuade
them to remain neutral.</p>

<p>Hugh Peters was selected for the purpose, and he
went among them, but all his efforts were fruitless.
They declared unanimously for the release of the King.
He then invited several of them, Calamy, Whitaker,
Sedgwick, etc., to a conference with some of the
officers; but instead of attending, the ministers assembled
in Sion College and drew up "A serious and
faithful representation of the judgment of the ministers
of the Gospel within the province of London," dated
18th January, 1648-9. In this they protested against
the coercive measures adopted toward the Parliament,
and bade them beware of proceeding to extremities.
"Examine your consciences, if any number of persons
of different principles from yourselves had invaded the
rights of Parliament, imprisoned the King, and carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
him about from place to place, and attempted the dissolution
of the whole government, whether you would
not have charged them with the highest crimes."</p>

<p>This was subscribed by forty-seven ministers.</p>

<p>A second paper, "A vindication of the London
ministers from the unjust aspersions ... as if they
had promoted the bringing of the King to capital
punishment," appeared shortly after, signed by fifty-seven
ministers.</p>

<p>Even the Independent preachers shrank from approving
the proceedings of the council of officers in
the trial of the King, with the exception of Hugh
Peters and John Goodwin. Some of the Independent
ministers in the country joined the Presbyterians in
protesting against them.</p>

<p>But it was all in vain. The King was tried and
sentenced to death, and executed on 30th January, 1649.
Rumour had it that the masked executioner was none
other than Peters himself. This he denied, asserting
that on the day of the King's death he was ill in bed.
He had certainly been about and preaching not many
days before.</p>

<p>Who the executioner was, was never discovered, and
Peters was not charged as such when tried for his life
in 1660.</p>

<p>In <i>Epulæ Thyestæ</i>, printed in 1649, Peters is accused
of having been the executioner of King Charles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's Peters, the Denyer, (nay 'tis sad)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that, disguised, cut off his Master's head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That godly pigeon of Apostacy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does buz about his Ante-Monarchy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His scaffold Doctrines.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there was an element of kindness in Hugh Peters
that induced him to do gracious acts even to those
whom he hated. Whitelocke assures us that "at a conference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
between him (Peters) and the King, the King
desired one of his own chaplains might be permitted to
come to him" on the occasion of his execution; he
had refused the ministrations of the Presbyterian
divines, "and thereupon the Bishop of London was
ordered to go to his Majesty."</p>

<p>On a former occasion a message from the Queen was
allowed to be transmitted to the King through the
instrumentality of Peters.</p>

<p>In his letter to his daughter Peters says: "I had
access to the King&mdash;he used me civilly, I, in requital,
offered my poor thoughts three times for his safety."
It was an impertinence in the man to approach the
King, when he had stirred up the army to demand his
death, and had raced about London endeavouring to
get the approval of the sentence from the ministers.
Although we cannot believe that Hugh Peters was the
executioner of Charles, yet he cannot be acquitted of
being a regicide, on the same principle as the trumpeter
in the fable was condemned to be hanged. His plea
that he had not drawn a sword in the battle was not
held to justify him&mdash;he had sounded the charge and
summoned to the battle.</p>

<p>Peters was one of the Triers appointed by Cromwell
to test the parochial clergy, and to eject from their
livings such as did not approve themselves to their
judgment as fitting pastors to the flock either by their
morals or theological opinions.</p>

<p>Every parishioner who bore a grudge against his
pastor was invited to lay his grievances before the
Grand Committee. Lord Clarendon says: "Petitions
presented by many parishioners against their pastors,
with articles of their misdemeanours and behaviours
... were read with great delight and promptly referred
to the Committee about Religion." The matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of these accusations was for the most part, as Clarendon
informs us, "bowing at the name of Jesus, and obliging
the communicants to the altar, i.e. to the rails
which enclosed the Communion table, to receive the
sacrament." What the Puritans desired was that
the minister should walk about the church distributing
to the people in the pews. The observance of all holy
days except Sundays had already been forbidden. A
priest who said service on Christmas Day or Good
Friday was certain of deprivation. But the great
question put to each rector or vicar was, "whether he
had any experience of a work of grace" in his heart,
and the answer to this determined whether he should
be allowed to hold his cure or be thrust out, apart from
all question of moral fitness. That there were a host
of lukewarm, indifferent men in the ministry, caring
little for religion and knowing little, without fixed convictions,
cannot be wondered at, after the swaying of
the pendulum of belief during the last reigns, and
these would be precisely the men who would be able
volubly to assert their experience of divine grace, and
abandon doctrines they never sincerely held and ceremonies
about which they cared nothing. There were
vicars of Bray everywhere.</p>

<span class="i0">As men try pipkins by the ringing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peters was next appointed a commissioner for the
amending of the laws, though he had no knowledge of
law. He said himself, in his <i>Legacy</i>: "When I was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
trier of others, I went to hear and gain experience,
rather than to judge; when I was called to mend laws,
I rather was there to pray than to mend laws." Whitelocke
says: "I was often advised with by some of this
committee, and none of them was more active in this
business than Mr. Hugh Peters, the minister, who understood
little of the law, but was very opinionative,
and would frequently mention some proceedings of law
in Holland, wherein he was altogether mistaken."</p>

<p>Peters was chaplain to the Protector, and certainly in
one way or another made a good deal of money. Dr.
Barwick in his Life says:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "The wild prophecies
uttered by his (Hugh Peters') impure mouth were still
received by the people with the same veneration as if
they had been oracles; though he was known to be
infamous for more than one kind of wickedness. A
fact which Milton himself did not dare to deny when
he purposely wrote his Apology, for this very end, to
defend even by name, as far as possible, the very
blackest of the conspirators, and Hugh Peters among
the chief of them, who were by name accused of manifest
impieties by their adversaries." Bishop Burnet says
as well: "He was a very vicious man."</p>

<p>Peters by his wife&mdash;his second wife, Deliverance, the
widow of a Mr. Sheffield&mdash;became the father of the
Elizabeth Peters to whom he addressed his <i>Dying
Father's Last Legacy</i>.</p>

<p>The Dutch having been disconcerted by the defeats
of their fleets by Admiral Blake, and the messengers
they had sent to England having failed to satisfy Cromwell,
in the beginning of the year 1653 they commissioned
Colonel Doleman and others to learn the sentiments
of the leading men in Parliament, and to gain
over to the cause of peace Hugh Peters, as Cromwell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
influential chaplain. Peters had always entertained a
tenderness for the Dutch, and he interceded on their
behalf, and the Dutch gave him £300,000 wherewith to
bribe and purchase the amity of Parliament and the
Protector. That a good share of this gold adhered to
Peters' fingers we may be pretty confident; and
indeed it was intended that it should do so. The
attempt, however, did not succeed, and when the negotiations
were broken off, the Dutch fitted out another
fleet under Van Tromp, De Witt, and De Ruyter, and
appointed four other deputies to go upon another
embassy to England. These men arrived on July 2nd,
1658, and "all joined in one petition for a common
audience, praying thrice humbly that they should have
a favourable answer, and beseeching the God of Peace
to co-operate."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>These ambassadors, like the foregoing, sought out
Peters and engaged his services. After several interviews,
peace was at last concluded 2nd May, 1654. In
the <i>Justification of the War</i>, by Stubbe, is an engraving
that represents the four deputies presenting their humble
petition to Peters.</p>

<p>In 1655 feeling in England was greatly stirred by the
account that reached the country of the persecution of
the Waldenses in the valleys of Piedmont. Cromwell
at once ordered a collection for the sufferers to be made
throughout the kingdom, and it amounted to upwards
of £38,000. In this Peters took an active part. Ludlow
says: "He was a diligent and earnest solicitor for the
distressed Protestants of the valleys of Piedmont."</p>

<p>Soon after the affair of the persecuted Waldenses
was concluded the Protector formed an alliance,
offensive and defensive, with the French, in which it
was agreed that Dunkirk should be delivered up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
him. In consequence of this agreement six thousand
men were sent over to join the French army, and
Peters received a commission to attend them thither.
The town of Dunkirk, in consequence of this league,
was taken from the Spaniards, and on the 26th of June,
1658, was delivered to Colonel Lockart, Cromwell's
ambassador at the French Court.</p>

<p>Lockart wrote the following letter to Secretary
Thurloe:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 25em;">"Dunkirk</span>, <i>July</i> 8-18<i>th</i>, 1658.<br />
<br />
"May it please your Lordship,<br />
</p>

<p>"I could not suffer my worthy friend, Mr. Peters,
to come away from Dunkirk without a testimony of the
great benefits we have all received from him in this
place, where he hath laid himself forth in great charity
and goodness in sermons, prayers, and exhortations,
in visiting and relieving the sick and wounded; and,
in all these, profitably applying the singular talent God
hath bestowed upon him to the chief ends, proper for
an auditory. For he hath not only showed the soldiers
their duty to God, and pressed it home upon them, I
hope with good advantage, but hath likewise acquainted
them with their obligations of obedience to his Highness's
government and affection to his person. He
hath laboured amongst us here with such goodwill,
and seems to enlarge his heart towards us, and care of
us for many other things, the effects whereof I design
to leave upon that Providence which has brought us
hither.... Mr. Peters hath taken leave at least three or
four times, but still something falls out which hinders
his return to England. He hath been twice at Bergh,
and hath spoke with the Cardinal (Mazarin) three or
four times; I kept myself by, and had a care that he did
not importune him with too long speeches. He returns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
loaden with an account of all things here, and
hath undertaken every man's business. I must give
him that testimony, that he gave us three or four very
honest sermons; and if it were possible to get him to
mind preaching, and to forbear the troubling himself
with other things, he would certainly prove a very fit
minister for soldiers. I hope he cometh well satisfied
from this place. He hath often insinuated to me his
desire to stay here, if he had a call. Some of the
officers also have been with me to that purpose; but I
have shifted him so handsomely as, I hope, he will not
be displeased. For I have told him that the greatest
service he can do us is to go to England and carry on
his propositions, and to own us in all other interests,
which he hath undertaken with much zeal."</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter lets us see what were some of Peters'
weaknesses. He was vastly loquacious, so that Colonel
Lockart had to see to it that he did not "importune
the Cardinal with too long speeches," and he was conceited,
self-opinionated, and meddlesome, interfering
in matters beyond his province, so that the Colonel was
heartily glad to be rid of him from Dunkirk.</p>

<p>That there was humour in Hugh Peters, not unfrequently
running into profanity, would appear from a
work, "The Tales and Jests of Mr. Hugh Peters, collected
into one volume; published by one that hath formerly
been conversant with the Author in his lifetime;
dedicated to Mr. John Goodwin and Mr. Philip Nye."
London, 1660.</p>

<p>These appeared in the same year under a different
title&mdash;"Hugh Peters, his figaries, or his merry tales
and witty jests both in city, town, and country." It
was reprinted by James Caulfield in 1807.</p>

<p>A few of these will suffice.</p>

<p>Peters had preached for two hours; the sands in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hour-glass had run out. He observed it, and turning
it over, said to his hearers: "Come, let us have another
glass!"</p>

<p>Once he preached: "Beware, young men, of the
three W's&mdash;Wine, Women, and Tobacco. Now Tobacco,
you will say, does not begin with a W. But
what is Tobacco but a weed?"</p>

<p>Another of his jests in the pulpit was, "England will
never prosper till one hundred and fifty are taken
away." The explanation is L L L&mdash;Lords, Lawyers,
and Levites.</p>

<p>Preaching on the devils entering into the swine
(S. Mark v. 23), he said that the miracle illustrated
three English proverbs:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the devil will rather play at small game than
sit out.</p>

<p>2. That those must needs go forward whom the devil
drives.</p>

<p>3. That at last he brought his hogs to a fair market.</p>

<p>It was a favourite saying of Peters that in Christendom
there were neither scholars enough, gentlemen
enough, nor Jews enough; for, said he, if there were
more scholars there would not be so many pluralists in
the Church; if there were more gentry, so many born
would not be reckoned among them; if there were
more Jews, so many Christians would not practise
usury.</p>

<p>One rainy day Oliver Cromwell offered Peters his
greatcoat. "No, thank you," replied his chaplain;
"I would not be in your coat for a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Discoursing one day on the advantage Christians
had in having the Gospel preached to them&mdash;"Verily,"
said he, "the Word hath a free passage amongst
you, for it goes in at one ear and out at the
other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Preaching on the subject of duties, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Observe the three fools in the Gospel, who, being
bid to the wedding supper, every one had his excuse&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. He that had hired a farm and must go see it.
Had he not been a fool, he would have seen it before
hiring it.</p>

<p>"2. He that had bought a yoke of oxen and must
go try them. He also was a fool, because he did not
try them before he bought them.</p>

<p>"3. He that married a wife, and without complement
said he could not come. He too was a fool, for he
showed that one woman drew him away, more than
a whole yoke of oxen did the former."</p>

<p>Peters, invited to dinner at a friend's house, knowing
him to be very wealthy and his wife very fat, said at
table to his host, "Truly, sir, you have the world and
the flesh, but pray God you get not the devil in the
end."</p>

<p>The copy of the <i>Tales and Jests of Hugh Peters</i> in the
British Museum has notes to some of them, showing
that the writer regarded a certain number as genuine
anecdotes of Peters. Most of the others are either
older stories, or else have little or no wit in them.</p>

<p>The above anecdotes are some of those thus noted.</p>

<p>That Hugh Peters was a wag Pepys lets us know,
for he speaks of a Scottish chaplain at Whitehall, after
the Restoration, a Dr. Creighton, whose humour reminded
the diarist of Peters: "the most comical man
that ever I heard; just such a man as Hugh Peters."</p>

<p>At the Restoration he was executed as a regicide.
He was not directly implicated in the King's death, and
all that he could be accused of was using words incentive
to regicide. That he had been the executioner
was not charged against him. There was no evidence.
The accusations Hugh Peters had to meet were that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
had encouraged the soldiers to cry out for the blood of
the King, whom he had likened to Barabbas; that he
had preached against him; that he had accused the
Levites, Lords, and Lawyers&mdash;the three L's, or the
Hundred and Fifty, in allusion to the numerical value
of the numbers&mdash;as men who should be swept out of
the Commonwealth; that he had declared the King to
be a tyrant, and that the office of King was useless and
dangerous.</p>

<p>Peters pleaded that he had been living fourteen
years out of England, and that when he came home he
found that the Civil War had already begun; that he
had not been at Edgehill or Naseby; that he had
looked after three things only&mdash;the introduction into
the country of what he considered to be sound religion,
the maintenance of learning, and the relief of the
poor. He further stated that on coming to England
he had considered it his duty to side with the Parliament,
and that he had acted without malice, avarice, or
ambition.</p>

<p>The jury, with very little consultation, returned a
verdict of guilty, and he was sentenced to death.</p>

<p>On the 16th October Coke, the solicitor for the people
of England who had acted against the King at his trial,
and Hugh Peters, who had stood and preached that no
mercy should be shown him, were to die.</p>

<p>On the hurdle which carried Coke was placed the
head of Harrison, who had been executed the day
before&mdash;a piece of needless brutality, which the people
who lined the streets indignantly resented. On the
scaffold Coke declared that for the part he had borne
in the trial of Charles I he in no way repented of what
he had done. Hugh Peters was made to witness all the
horrible details of Coke's execution, the hanging, the
disembowelling. He sat within the rails which surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the scaffold. According to Ludlow: "When
this victim (Coke) was cut down and brought to be
quartered, one Colonel Turner called to the sheriff's
men to bring Mr. Peters to see what was doing; which
being done, the executioner came to him, and rubbing
his bloody hands together, asked him how he liked
that work. He told him he was not at all terrified, and
that he might do his worst, and when he was on the
ladder he said to the sheriff, 'Sir, you have butchered
one of the servants of God before my eyes, and have
forced me to see it, in order to terrify and discourage
me; but God has permitted it for my support and encouragement.'"</p>

<p>A man upbraided Peters with the King's death.
"Friend," said Peters, "you do not well to trample
upon a dying man: you are greatly mistaken; I had
nothing to do in the death of the King."</p>

<p>As he was going to the gallows, he looked about him
and espied a man with whom he was acquainted, and
to him he gave a piece of money, having first bent it;
and he desired the man to carry that piece of gold to
his daughter as a token, and to assure her that his
heart was full of comfort, and that before that piece
would reach her hand he would be with God in glory.
Then the old preacher, who had lived in storms
and whirlwinds, died with a quiet smile on his countenance.</p>

<p>That a considerable portion of the community regarded
the execution of the regicides as a crime, and
those who suffered as martyrs, would appear from the
pains taken to vilify their memory when dead, and
attempts made to justify their execution.</p>

<h2>JAMES POLKINGHORNE,
THE WRESTLER</h2>


<p>James Polkinghorne, the noted champion
wrestler of Cornwall, was the son of James
Polkinghorne, who died at Creed, 18th March,
1836. The wrestler James was born at S.
Keverne in 1788, but there is no entry of his baptism
in the parish register.</p>

<p>Cornish wrestling was very different from that in
Devon&mdash;it was less brutal, as no kicking was allowed.
The Devon wrestlers wore boots soaked in bullock's
blood and indurated at the fire, and with these hacked
the shins of their opponents, who wore as a protection
<i>skillibegs</i>, or bands of hay twisted and wrapped round
their legs below the knee.</p>

<p>I have so fully described the wrestling in my <i>Devonshire
Characters and Strange Events</i>, that it is unnecessary
here to go over the same ground more than
cannot be helped.</p>

<p>There was a Cornish jingle that ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chacewater boobies up in a tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking as whish'd as ever could be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truro men, strong as oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knock 'em down at every stroke&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that had reference to the wrestling matches.</p>

<p>In 1816 Polkinghorne, who had become the innkeeper
of the "Red Lion," S. Columb Major, wrestled
with Flower, a Devonshire man of gigantic stature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and threw him. Then Jackman, another Devonian,
challenged Polkinghorne, and he was cast over the
head of the Cornishman, describing the "flying mare."
But the most notable contest in which Polkinghorne
was engaged was with Abraham Cann, the Devonshire
champion. The match was for £200 a side, for the best
of three back-falls; and it took place on October 23rd,
1826, on Tamar Green, Morice Town, Plymouth, in the
presence of seventeen thousand spectators. I have
quoted the account already in my <i>Devonshire Characters</i>,
but cannot omit it here.</p>

   <p class="caption2">JAMES POLKINHORN, THE FAMOUS CORNISH WRESTLER<br />
<i>From a drawing as he appeared in the Ring at Devonport on Monday,</i>
23 <i>October</i>, 1826, <i>when he threw Abm. Cann, the Champion of Devonshire,
for a stake of</i> 200 <i>sovereigns</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Tamar Green, Devonport, was chosen for the purpose,
and the West was alive with speculation when it
was known that the backers meant business. On the
evening before the contest the town was inundated,
and the resources of its hotels and inns were taxed to
the utmost. Truculent and redoubtable gladiators
flocked to the scene&mdash;kickers from Dartmoor, the
recruiting-ground of the Devonshire system, and bearlike
huggers from the land of Tre, Pol, and Pen&mdash;a
wonderful company of tried and stalwart experts. Ten
thousand persons bought tickets at a premium for
seats, and the hills around swarmed with spectators.
The excitement was at the highest possible pitch, and
overwhelming volumes of cheering relieved the tension
as the rivals entered the ring&mdash;Polkinghorne in his stockings,
and Cann with a monstrous pair of shoes whose
toes had been baked into flints. As the men peeled for
action such a shout ascended as awed the nerves of all
present. Polkinghorne had been discounted as fat and
unwieldy, but the Devonians were dismayed to find
that, great as was his girth, his arms were longer, and
his shoulders immensely powerful. Three stone lighter
in weight, Cann displayed a more sinewy form, and his
figure was knit for strength, and as statuesquely proportioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
His grip, like Polkinghorne's, was well
known. No man had ever shaken it off when once he
had clinched; and each enjoyed a reputation for
presence of mind and resource in extremity beyond
those of other masters of the art. The match was for
the best of three back-falls, the men to catch what hold
they could; and two experts from each county were
selected as sticklers. The feeling was in favour of
Cann at the outset, but it receded as the Cornishman
impressed the multitude with his muscular superiority.
Repeatedly shifting their positions, the combatants
sought their favourite 'holds.' As soon as Cann
caught his adversary by the collar, after a contending
display of shifty and evasive form, Polkinghorne
released himself by a feint; and, amid 'terrible shouts
from the Cornishmen,' he drove his foe to his knees.</p>

<p>"Nothing daunted, the Devonian accepted the Cornish
hug, and the efforts of the rivals were superb.
Cann depended on his science to save him, but Polkinghorne
gathered his head under his arm, and lifting him
from the ground, threw him clean over his shoulder,
and planted him on his back. The very earth groaned
with the uproar that followed; the Cornishmen jumped
by hundreds into the ring; there they embraced their
champion till he begged to be released; and, amid
cheers and execrations, the fall was announced to have
complied with the conditions. Bets to the amount of
hundreds of pounds were decided by this event.</p>

<p>"Polkinghorne now went to work with caution, and
Cann was conscious that he had an awkward customer
to tackle. After heavy kicking and attempted hugging,
the Cornishman tried once more to lift his opponent;
but Cann caught his opponent's leg in his descent, and
threw him to the ground first. In the ensuing rounds
both men played for wind. Polkinghorne was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
more distressed, his knees quite raw with punishment,
and the betting veered in Cann's favour. Then the
play changed, and Cann was apparently at the mercy of
his foe, when he upset Polkinghorne's balance by a
consummate effort, and threw him on his back by sheer
strength&mdash;the first that the sticklers allowed him. Cann
next kicked tremendously; but although the Cornishman
suffered severely, he remained 'dead game,' and
twice saved himself by falling on his chest.</p>

<p>"Disputes now disturbed the umpires, and their
number was reduced to two. In the eighth round
Polkinghorne's strength began to fail, and a dispute
was improvised which occasioned another hour's delay.
With wind regained and strength revived, the tenth
round was contested with absolute fury; and, taking
kicking with fine contempt, Polkinghorne gripped Cann
with leonine majesty, lifted him from the earth in his
arms, turned him over his head, and dashed him to the
ground with stunning force. As the Cornishman
dropped on his knee the fall was disputed, and the turn
was disallowed. Polkinghorne then left the ring amid
a mighty clamour, and by reason of his default the
stakes were awarded to Cann. The victor emerged
from the terrific hug of his opponent with a mass
of bruises, which proved that kicking was only one
degree more effective than hugging.</p>

<p>"A more unsatisfactory issue could hardly have been
conceived, and the rival backers forthwith endeavoured
to arrange another encounter. Polkinghorne refused
to meet Cann, however, unless he discarded his shoes."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Various devices were attempted to bring them together
again, but they failed. Each had a wholesome
dread of the other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>An account of the contest was written as a ballad and
was entitled "A New Song on the Wrestling Match
between Cann and Polkinghorne," that was to be sung
to the tune "The Night I Married Susy," or else to
"The Coronation."</p>

<p>Full accounts are to be found in <i>The Sporting Magazine</i>,
London, LXVII, 165-6; LXIX, 55-6, 215, 314-16,
344. In the <i>Annual Register</i>, chronicle 1826, 157-8.</p>

<p>Polkinghorne died at S. Columb, on September 15th,
1854, at the age of seventy-six, twenty-eight years after
his match with Cann. He was buried on September
17th.</p>

<h2>HENRY TRENGROUSE, INVENTOR</h2>


<p>Helston is a quaint old town, once of far
more importance than at present. It possessed
an old castle, that has now disappeared.
It was one of the six stannary
towns, and prior to 1832 returned two members to
Parliament. It still glories in its "Furry Day," when
the whole town goes mad, dancing, in spite of Methodism.
It has on some of its old house-gables pixy
seats, and it had a grammar school that has had notable
masters, as Derwent Coleridge, and notable scholars,
as Henry Trengrouse. It is the key and capital to that
wonderful district, rich in geological and botanic and
antiquarian interest, the Lizard.</p>

<p>The great natural curiosity of Helston is Loe Pool,
formed by the Comber, a small river, penned back by
Loe Bar, a pebble-and-sand ridge thrown up by the
sea. The sheet of water lying between wooded hills
abounds in trout, and white swans float dreamily over
the still water. The banks are rich with fern, and
yellow, white, and pink mesembryanthemum. Formerly
the pool rose till it overflowed the lower parts
of the town; now a culvert has been driven through
the rocks to let off the water as soon as it has attained
a certain height.</p>

<p>Henry Trengrouse was born at Helston, 18th March,
1772, the son of Nicholas Trengrouse (1739-1814), and
of Mary, his wife, who was a Williams.</p>

<p>The family had been long among the freeholders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Helston, and possessed as well a small estate, Priske,
in the parish of Mullion; but the family name is taken
from Tref-an-grouse, the House by the Cross, in the
same parish.</p>

<p>Henry was educated in Helston Grammar School,
and became, by trade, a cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>On 29th December, 1807, when he was aged thirty-five,
a rumour spread through the little town that a
large frigate, H.M.S. <i>Anson</i>, had been driven ashore
on Loe Bar, about three miles distant. Mr. Trengrouse
and many others hastened to the coast and reached the
bar.</p>

<p>The <i>Anson</i>, forty-four guns, under the command of
Captain Lydiard, had left Falmouth on Christmas Eve
for her station off Brest as a look-out ship for the
Channel Fleet.</p>

<p>A gale from the W.S.W. sprang up, and after being
buffeted about till the 28th, with the wind increasing,
the captain determined to run to port. The first land
they made was the Land's End, which they mistook
for the Lizard, and only discovered their mistake when
the cry of "Breakers ahead!" was heard from the man
on the look-out. They were now embayed, and in
face of the terrible storm it was impossible to work off,
so both cables were let go. The <i>Anson</i> rode to these
till the early morning of the 29th, when they parted,
and the captain, in order to save as many lives as
possible, decided to beach her on the sand off Loe Pool.
A tremendous sea was running, and as she took the
beach only sixty yards from the bar, she was dashed
broadside on, and happily for the poor fellows on
board, heeled landwards. Seas mountains high rolled
over her, sweeping everything before them. Then her
masts went by the board, her main mast forming a floating
raft from the ship almost to the shore, and over this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
scrambled through the maddened waves most of those
who were saved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/i_094.png" alt="HENRY TRENGROUSE" title="HENRY TRENGROUSE" />
   <p class="caption2">HENRY TRENGROUSE, THE INVENTOR OF THE ROCKET APPARATUS
FOR SAVING LIFE AT SEA<br />
<i>From an oil painting by Opie the younger, reproduced by permission of Mr. H. Trengrouse</i></p>
</div>

<p>It was a terrible sight to witness for the hundreds of
spectators who had by this time collected on the beach,
but it was almost impossible for them to render any
assistance.</p>

<p>At last, when all hands seemed to have left the ship,
two stout-hearted Methodist local preachers&mdash;Mr. Tobias
Roberts, of Helston, and Mr. Foxwell, of Mullion&mdash;made
an attempt to reach her, so as to see if any one
remained on board. They succeeded, and were soon
followed by others, who found several people, including
two women and as many children. The women and
some of the men were safely conveyed ashore, but the
children were drowned. There were altogether upwards
of a hundred drowned, including the captain,
who stood by the frigate to the last. The exact number
was never known, as many of the soldiers deserted on
reaching the shore.</p>

<p>The survivors salved a good deal from the wreck,
amongst which were watches, jewellery, and many
articles of considerable value. They were placed all together
in a bedroom of the old inn at Porthleven, with
a soldier with drawn sword on guard. One of the
beams that bent under such an unusual weight may be
seen bowed to this day. A local militia sergeant was
soon afterwards sent to Helston in charge of a wagon-load
of these valuable goods, and when half-way to his
destination was accosted by a Jew, who offered him
£50 in exchange for his load. "Here is my answer,"
said the sergeant, presenting a loaded pistol at his
head, and the fellow hurriedly took his departure.</p>

<p>Much indignation was raised at the time by the way
in which the victims of the disaster were buried. They
were bundled in heaps into large pits dug in the cliff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
above, without any burial service being performed over
them. It was customary everywhere at that time for all
bodies washed ashore to be interred by the finder at
the nearest convenient spot. But as a result of the indecent
methods of burial of the <i>Anson</i> victims, an Act
of Parliament was framed by Mr. Davies Gilbert, and
passed on 18th June, 1808, providing "suitable interment
in churchyards and parochial burying-grounds"
for all bodies cast up by the sea.</p>

<p>The <i>Anson</i> was a sixty-four gun frigate cut down
to a forty-four, and had seen much service. Among
many fights, she figured in Lord Rodney's action on
12th April, 1782, formed part of the fleet which repulsed
the French squadron in an attempt to land in
Ireland in 1796, helped in the seizure of the French
West Indies in 1803, and in 1807 took part in the capture
of Curaçao from the Dutch. It was not long after
her return from this latter place that she left Falmouth
for the cruise on which she met her fate.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1902 the hull of the <i>Anson</i>, after having been
submerged for ninety-five years, came to light again.
She was found by Captain Anderson of the West of
England Salvage Company, whose attention had been
directed to the wreck by a Porthleven fisherman. Unfortunately
at the time the weather was so stormy that
Captain Anderson could not proceed with any efforts
of salvage, and with the exception of one visit of
inspection the interesting relic was left untouched.
But in April, 1903, with a bright sky and a light breeze
from the north-east, he proceeded to the spot and inspected
the remains. The hull of the vessel was not
intact, and several guns were lying alongside. One of
these, about 10 ft. 6 in. long, Captain Anderson secured
and hoisted on to the deck of the <i>Green Castle</i> by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of a winch, and afterwards conveyed it to Penzance. It
was much encrusted. Amongst the mass of <i>débris</i> also
raised were several cannon-balls.</p>

<p>But to return to Henry Trengrouse, who had stood
on the beach watching the wreck, the rescue of some
and the perishing of others.</p>

<p>Drenched with rain and spray, and sick at heart,
Henry Trengrouse returned to his home, and was confined
to his bed for nearly a week, having contracted
a severe cold. The terrible scene had made an indelible
impression on his mind, and he could not, even
if he had wished it, drive the thought away. Night
and day he mused on the means whereby some assistance
could be given to the shipwrecked, some communication
be established between the vessel and the
shore.</p>

<p>He was a great friend of Samuel Drew, whose
life was devoted to metaphysics, and it was perhaps
the contrast in the two minds that made them friends&mdash;one
an idealist, the other practical.</p>

<p>Trengrouse had a small competence, besides his trade,
and he devoted every penny that he could spare to
experiments, first in the construction of a lifeboat, but
without satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The King's birthday was celebrated at Helston with
fireworks on the green; and as Henry Trengrouse
looked up at the streak of fire rushing into the darkness
above and scattering a shower of stars, it occurred to
him, Why should not a rocket, instead of wasting
itself in an exhibition of fireworks, do service and
become a means of carrying a rope to a vessel among
the breakers? When a communication has been established
between the wreck and the shore, above the
waves, it may become an aerial passage along which
those in distress may pass to safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Something of the same idea had already occurred to
Lieutenant John Bell in 1791, but his proposal was that
a shot with a chain attached to it should be discharged
from a mortar. Captain George William Manby had
his attention drawn to this in February, 1807, and in
August of the same year exhibited some experiments
with his improved life-preserving mortar to the members
of the Suffolk House Humane Society. By the
discharge of the mortar a barbed shot was to be flung
on to the wreck, with a line attached to the shot. By
means of this line a hawser could be drawn from the
shore to the ship, and along it would be run a cradle in
which the shipwrecked persons could be drawn to land.</p>

<p>Manby's mortar was soon abandoned as cumbrous
and dangerous; men were killed during tests; notwithstanding
which he was awarded, £2000. The great
merit of Trengrouse's invention was that the rocket
was much lighter than a shot from a mortar, and was,
moreover, more portable, and there was a special line
manufactured for it that would not kink, nor would
it snap, because the velocity of the rocket increased
gradually, whereas that from a discharge of a mortar
was sudden and so great that the cord was frequently
ruptured.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of Trengrouse's apparatus
consisted of "a section of a cylinder, which is fitted to
the barrel of a musket by a bayonet socket; a rocket
with a line attached to its stick is so placed on it that its
priming receives fire immediately from the barrel";<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
whereas a metal mortar could not be conveyed to the
cliff or shore opposite the scene of disaster without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
being drawn in a conveyance by horses, and where
there was no road with the utmost difficulty dragged
over hedges and ploughed fields by men. Not only so,
but a shot discharged by Captain Manby's mortar was
liable to endanger life. Wrecks generally happened
in the dark, and then the shot would not be visible to
those on the wreck. But Trengrouse's rocket would
indicate its track by the trail of fire by which it was
impelled, and could be fired from either the ship or the
shore.</p>

<p>Trengrouse expended £3000 on his experiments, and
sacrificed to this one object&mdash;that of saving life&mdash;his
capital, his business, and his health. He cut off
the entail on Priske, which had belonged to the
family for several generations, and sold it to enable
him to pursue his experiments. There was much
that was pathetic in his life: there were the long
and frequent journeys to London from Helston, four
days by coach, sometimes in mid-winter and in snowstorms,
with the object of inducing successive Governments
to adopt the rocket apparatus, meeting only with
discouragement. Nor was this all. After all his own
means had been exhausted, he received a legacy of
£500 under a brother's will, and this sum he at once
devoted to further endeavours with H.M. Government
for the general adoption of his rocket apparatus.</p>

<p>The Russian ambassador now stepped forward and
invited Trengrouse to S. Petersburg, where he assured
him that, instead of rebuffs, he would experience only
the consideration due to him for his inventions. But
Trengrouse's reply was, "My country first"; and
that country allowed him, after the signal services he
had rendered to humanity&mdash;to die penniless.</p>

<p>His original design was to supply every ship with a
rocket apparatus; as vessels were almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
wrecked <i>before</i> the wind, the line might the more easily
be fired from a ship than from the shore.</p>

<p>Trengrouse once met Sir William Congreve, who
also claimed to be the inventor of the war-rocket; and
Trengrouse said to him in the course of their discussion,
"As far as I can see, Sir William, your
rocket is designed to <i>destroy</i> life; mine is to save life;
and I do claim to be the first that ever thought of
utilizing a rocket for the saving of human lives."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Trengrouse moreover invented the cork jacket or
"life preserver." This was a success, and has never
been improved on. It has been the means of saving
many hundreds of lives. He also built a model of a
lifeboat, that could not be sunk, and was equal to the
present lifeboats of the Royal Lifeboat Association
in all respects except the "self-righting" principle.
It was not until February 28th, 1818, after many journeys
to London, and much ignorant and prejudiced
objection that he had to contend against, such as is
found so usual among Government officials, that Trengrouse
was able to exhibit his apparatus before Admiral
Sir Charles Rowley. A committee was appointed, and
on March 5th it reported favourably on the scheme.</p>

<p>In the same year the Committee of the Elder
Brethren of Trinity House reported in high terms
on the invention, and recommended that "no vessel
should be without it."</p>

<p>Thereupon Government began to move slowly; in
the House the matter was discussed and haggled over.
One speaker exclaimed: "You are guilty of sinful
negligence in this matter, for while you are parleying
over this invention and this important subject, thousands
of our fellow-men are losing their lives."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Government ordered twenty sets of the life-preserving
rockets, but afterwards resolved on making
the apparatus itself, and paid Trengrouse the sum of
£50, the supposed amount of profit he would have
made on the order. Fifty pounds was all his ungrateful
country could afford to give him. In 1821, however,
the Society of Arts pronounced favourably on
his apparatus, and presented Trengrouse with their
silver medal and a grant of thirty guineas.</p>

<p>Through the Russian ambassador, the then Czar sent
him a diamond ring, in consideration of the great
advantage his apparatus had proved in shipwrecks on
the Baltic and the Black Sea. Even this he was constrained
to pledge, that he might devote the money to
his darling project.</p>

<p>With these acknowledgments of his services he had
to rest contented; but ever the news of lives having
been saved through his invention was a solace to an
even and contented mind.</p>

<p>Henry Trengrouse died at Helston on February
19th, 1854.</p>

<p>As he lay on his death-bed with his face to the wall,
he turned about, and with one of his bright, hopeful
smiles said to his son, "If you live to be as old as
I am, you will find my rocket apparatus all along our
shores." They were his last words; in a few minutes
he had passed away.</p>

<p>The rocket apparatus is along the shores at 300
stations, but not, as he had hoped, on board the
vessels. He had despaired of obtaining that, yet that
is what he aimed at principally.</p>

<p>In April, 1905, owing to the loss of the <i>Kyber</i> on
the Land's End coast, questions were asked in the
House of Commons relative to wireless telegraphy
between the lighthouses and the coast. On that occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
one of the most valuable suggestions was made
by a shipping expert, who considered that the Board
of Trade should make it compulsory that a light rocket
apparatus should be carried by all vessels, so that,
when in distress, if near the coast, the crew could send
a rocket ashore. This marine engineer said: "On
shore the rockets must be fired by practised men, such
as coastguards, because they have to strike a small
object; but on a vessel they have only to hit the land, and
if people are about, the line will quickly be seized and
made fast. At present, too, horses and wagons have to be
used, and sometimes it is difficult to find a road leading
down to the spot from which help must be rendered.
Probably for twenty pounds an appliance could be kept
on board a vessel which would send a line ashore in less
time and with more certainty than at present. When
a vessel is being blown ashore, I have seen rockets
fired from the land return like a boomerang to the cliff
on account of the strength of the gale. In my judgment,
mariners should assist in their own salvation."</p>

<p>On this Mr. H. Trengrouse, grandson of the inventor,
wrote to the <i>Cornishman</i>, 24th April, 1905:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your suggestion in the <i>Cornishman</i> of the 15th
instant ... that all vessels should be compelled by
the Board of Trade to carry this apparatus, is very
practical, and should, and I trust may, be soon
adopted.</p>

<p>"It may interest your readers to learn that the inventor,
my grandfather, the late Mr. Henry Trengrouse,
of Helston, urged this upon successive Governments
without any encouragement whatever, and I on
two occasions have also suggested it to the principals
of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade, who
have informed me of a strong opinion always entertained,
that on the occasion of wreck, there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
probably not be any one on board possessing sufficient
knowledge of the use of the apparatus to render it of
any value; which seems very strange indeed, and
might be readily obviated by, at least, the captain and
officers of vessels being instructed in its use&mdash;surely
simple enough. My grandfather devoted much time
to make it so; and the advantage of an appliance for
use on board is so palpable, and the loss of life during
many years by its absence so considerable, that it is
extremely gratifying to observe a renewed and increasing
interest in the subject, which I hope, Sir, as you
state, being so important, may now be kept to the fore.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 29.5em;">"I am, Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 31.5em;">"Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 35.5em;">"<span class="smcap">H. Trengrouse</span>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>That this admirable letter to the <i>Cornishman</i> should
at the time produce no effect on the Board of Trade
is what every one who has had any dealings with that
Board would predicate.</p>

<p>At length, however, some goading has roused that
obstructive, inert body into inquiring into this matter.
I read in the <i>Daily Express</i> of 27th January, 1908:
"The question whether the carrying of rockets for
projecting lifelines should be made compulsory on all
British ships is being investigated by a special committee
appointed by the Board of Trade. One witness
before the committee said that he had seen fifty men
drowned within sixty yards of the shore in a gale, and
that all might have been saved had the vessel been
equipped with line-throwing guns."</p>

<p>So&mdash;after the lapse of eighty-six or seven years, and
the loss of thousands of lives that might have been
saved had not the Board of Trade been too inert to
move in the matter&mdash;an inquiry has once more been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
instituted. Let us hope that after this inquiry the
matter may not be allowed to fall again into neglect.</p>

<p>That the rocket <i>fired from the shore</i> has been already
the means of saving lives, the following report on it
made to the Board of Trade, for the year ending
30th June, 1907, will testify:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During the year ended as above, 268 lives were
saved by means of the life-saving apparatus, that is to
say, 127 more than the number saved by the same
means during the previous year, and 67 more than the
average for the previous ten years. The total number
of lives saved by the life-saving apparatus since 1870
is 8924. This number does not include the large
number of lives saved by means of ropes and other
assistance from the shore."</p>

<p>After the loss of the <i>Berlin</i>, belonging to the Great
Eastern Company, in 1907, the attention of the Dutch
Government was called to the advantage of having the
rocket apparatus <i>on board ship</i>, and legal instructions
were drafted, making it obligatory upon all vessels of
over two hundred tons gross to carry rocket apparatus.</p>

<p>Henry Trengrouse's noble life was a failure in so
far as that it brought him no pecuniary results&mdash;covered
him with disappointment, reduced him to poverty. He
received, in all, for his life's work, and the sacrifice of
fortune and the landed estate of his ancestors, £50
from Government, £31 10<i>s.</i> from the Society of Arts,
and a diamond ring that in his time of need he was
constrained to pawn, and which he was never able to
redeem.</p>

<p>Russell Lowell puts these lines into the mouth of
Cromwell, in his <i>Glance behind the Curtain</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Henry Trengrouse married Mary, daughter of Samuel
and Mary Jenken, 19th November, 1795. She was born
at S. Erth, 9th September, 1772, and died at Helston,
27th March, 1863. By her he had one son only who
reached manhood, Nicholas Trevenen Trengrouse, who
died at the age of seventy-four; and one daughter, Jane,
who married Thomas Rogers, solicitor, of Helston;
Emma, who married a Mr. Matthews; and two, Mary
and Anne, who died unmarried, the first at the age of
eighty, the latter at that of ninety-four.</p>

<p>To Mr. Henry Trengrouse, the son of Mr. Nicholas
T. Trengrouse, I am indebted for much information
relative to his grandfather, as also to a lecture, never
published, delivered in 1894 by the Rev. James
Ninnis, who says in a letter to Mr. H. Trengrouse,
junior: "Most of the detail I have taken from notes
of my father, dated 1878; he got them from conversation
with your respected father."</p>

<p>Mr. J. Ninnis' grandfather had stood on the beach
by the side of Henry Trengrouse, watching the wreck
of the <i>Anson</i>.</p>

both I am indebted to the courtesy of the grandson
of the inventor.</p>

<h2>THE BOTATHAN GHOST</h2>


<p>IN April, 1720, Daniel Defoe published his <i>History
of the Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan
Campbell</i>. In August a second edition was
called for, of which some copies included a
pamphlet that had been printed in June: "Mr. Campbell's
Pacquet, for the Entertainment of Gentlemen and
Ladies," and this "Pacquet" contains "A Remarkable
Passage of an Apparition, related by the Rev. Dr.
Ruddle, of Launceston, in Cornwall, in the year 1665."</p>

<p>It has been assumed that this ghost story was a bit of
invention of the lively imagination of Defoe. Mrs.
Bray in her <i>Trelawny of Trelawne</i> stated that the story
could not be true, as no such a name as Dingley, which
was that of the ghost, was known in Launceston. As
it happened, James Dingley had been instituted to the
vicarage of the very parish of South Petherwin, in
which the ghost appeared, in the same reign in which
the apparition occurred, and he assisted Ruddle in his
ministrations in Launceston, and the name occurs to this
day in the town and neighbourhood. In fact, Dingley,
Pethebridge, and Dingley are bankers there.</p>

<p>In the same heedless fashion Cyrus Redding wrote
in 1842 that the story was "told with so much simplicity
of truth that it is difficult to believe that the tale is not,
as novel writers say, 'founded on fact.'" And he goes
on to state: "No clergyman of the name of Ruddle had
been incumbent in Launceston for two hundred years
past, at least in S. Mary's Church." Yet the monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of Parson Ruddle is in the church, and he
occupied the living from 1663 to his death in 1699.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_110.png" id="i_110.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_110.png" alt="PARSON RUDALL" title="PARSON RUDALL" />
   <p class="caption2">"PARSON RUDALL"<br />
<i>From a painting in the possession of the Rev. S. Baring Gould</i></p>
</div>

<p>Again, Samuel Drew, in his <i>History of Cornwall</i>,
blunders as to the locality, making the apparition
appear in the parish of Little Petherick, near Padstow.</p>

<p>Next Mr. Hawker, of Morwenstow, fabricated a
"Diurnall" of Ruddle, which adopted Drew's error,
and by altering the date made the story as given by
him disagree with the facts as they stand upon record.</p>

<p>The "Remarkable Passage of an Apparition" was no
invention of Defoe; it was a genuine narrative written
by the hand of John Ruddle himself. This has been
conclusively demonstrated by the late Mr. Alfred
Robbins in the <i>Cornish Magazine</i>, 1898.</p>

<p>John Ruddle, M.A. of Caius College, Cambridge,
was instituted to the vicarage of Altarnon on May
24th, 1662; and the incumbency of S. Mary Magdalen,
Launceston, becoming vacant by the ejection of the
Independent intrusive pastor, Ruddle was appointed
to it, and "began his ministry at Launceston on y<sup>e</sup>
Feast of Our Saviour's Nativity, 1663." At the same
time he received the appointment to the Launceston
Free School as master.</p>

<p>Now it so fell out that he was invited on the 20th
June, 1665, to preach a funeral sermon on the occasion
of the burial of John Eliot at South Petherwin. John
was the son of Edward Eliot, of Trebursey, who was
the third son of Sir John Eliot, who died in the Tower
of London.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the service, Parson Ruddle
was leaving the church, when an "ancient gentleman"
addressed him, and, Ruddle says, "With an unusual
importunity almost forced against my humour to see
his house that night; nor could I have rescued myself
from his kindness, had not Mr. Eliot interposed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
pleaded title to me for the whole of the day." However,
Ruddle promised to call on the old gentleman,
whose name was Bligh, and whose house was Botathan.</p>

<p>The Blighs were an ancient family, well connected
and owning a good estate, but Botathan was not a
house of any pretence, and it is now the dwelling of a
farmer, and has not the appearance of having been the
residence of a county family.</p>

<p>On the following Monday John Ruddle went to
Botathan, where he partook of an early dinner, and
a neighbouring parson had been invited to meet
him.</p>

<p>"After dinner this brother of the coat undertook to
show me the gardens, when, as I was walking, he
gave me the first discovery of what was mainly intended
in all this treat and compliment. First he began
to tell the infortunity of the family in general, and
then gave an instance in the youngest son. He related
what a hopeful, sprightly lad he lately was, and
how melancholic and sottish he was now grown. Then
did he with much passion lament that his ill-humour
should so incredibly subdue his reason; for, says he,
the poor boy believes himself to be haunted with
ghosts, and is confident that he meets with an evil
spirit in a certain field about half a mile from this
place as often as he goes that way to school.</p>

<p>"In the midst of our twaddle the old gentleman and
his lady came up to us. Upon their approach, and
pointing me to the arbour, the parson renews the relation
to me; and they (the parents of the youth)
confirmed what he said, and added many minute circumstances.
In fine, they all three desired my
thoughts and advice in the affair."</p>

<p>Neither the parents nor the parson who made this
communication believed that the boy saw anything;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
they shrewdly suspected that he was lazy, and made
the apparition an excuse for not going to school.</p>

<p>Ruddle, however, saw the boy, and was convinced of
his sincerity. "He told me with all naked freedom,
and a flood of tears, that his friends were unkind and
unjust to him, neither to believe nor pity him; and
that if any man (making a bow to me) would but go
with him to the place, he might be convinced that the
thing was real.</p>

<p>"'This woman which appears to me,' saith he,
'lived a neighbour here to my father, and died about
eight years since; her name, Dorothy Dingley. She
never speaks to me, but passeth by hastily, and always
leaves the footpath to me, and she commonly meets me
twice or three times in the breadth of the field.</p>

<p>"'It was about two months before I took notice of it,
and though the shape of the face was in my memory,
yet I did not recall the name of the person, but I did
suppose it was some woman who lived there about, and
had frequent occasion that way. Nor did I imagine
anything to the contrary before she began to meet me
constantly, morning and evening, and always in the
same field (the Higher Brown Quartils), and sometimes
twice or thrice in the breadth of it.</p>

<p>"'The first time I took notice of her was about
a year since, and when I first began to suspect it to be
a ghost, I had courage enough not to be afraid, but
kept it to myself a good while, and only wondered very
much about it. I did often speak to it, but never had
a word in answer. Then I changed my way, and went
to school the under Horse Road, and then she always
met me in the narrow lane, between the Quarry Park
and the Nursery, which was worse. At length I began
to be terrified at it, and prayed continually that God
would either free me from it or let me know the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of it. Night and day, sleeping and waking, the
shape was ever running in my mind, when, by
degrees, I grew pensive, inasmuch that it was taken
notice of by all our family; whereupon, being urged
to it, I told my brother William of it, and he privately
acquainted my father and mother, and they kept it to
themselves for some time.</p>

<p>"'The success of this discovery was only this: they
did sometimes laugh at me, sometimes chide me, but
still commanded me to keep to my school, and put such
fopperies out of my head. I did accordingly go to
school often, but always met the woman by the way.'"</p>

<p>When Parson Ruddle had heard this story he promised
the boy to go with him next morning to the field,
and went with the lad to the hall, whither the parents
and the parson, the Rev. Samuel Williams, came to
meet them from the parlour. They began at once to
importune Ruddle about the interview and to pass
remarks on the boy, who fled from them to his own
room. The vicar of Launceston begged them to restrain
their curiosity till he had made further investigation
into the matter.</p>

<p>"The next morning, before five o'clock, the lad was
in my chambers, and very brisk. I arose and went
with him. The field he led me to I guessed to be
twenty acres, in an open country, and about three furlongs
from any house. We went into the field, and
had not gone above a third part before the spectrum, in
the shape of a woman, with all the circumstances he
had described her to me the day before, met us and
passed by. I was a little surprised at it, and though I
had taken up a firm resolution to speak to it, yet I had
not the power, nor indeed durst I look back; yet I took
care not to show any fear to my pupil and guide, and
therefore telling him that I was satisfied in the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
his complaint, we walked to the end of the field and returned,
nor did the ghost meet us that time above
once.</p>

<p>"At our return the gentlewoman watched to speak
with me. I gave her a convenience, and told her that
my opinion was that her son's complaint was not to be
slighted, yet that my judgment in his case was not
settled. I gave her caution that the thing might not
take wind, lest the whole country should ring with what
we had yet no assurance of.</p>

<p>"In this juncture of time I had business which
would admit no delay, wherefore I went to Launceston
that evening, but promised to see them again next
week. Yet I was prevented by an occasion which
pleaded a sufficient excuse. However, my mind was
upon the adventure. I studied the case, and about
three weeks after went again, resolving, by the help of
God, to see the utmost.</p>

<p>"The next morning, the 27th day of July, 1665, I
went to the haunted field by myself, and walked the
breadth of the field without any encounter. I returned
and took the other walk, and then the spectrum appeared
to me, much about the same place where I saw
it before, when the young gentleman was with me. In
my thoughts it moved swifter than the time before, and
about ten feet distant from me on my right hand, insomuch
that I had not time to speak, as I had determined
with myself beforehand.</p>

<p>"The evening of this day, the parents, the son, and
myself being in the chamber where I lay, I propounded
to them our going all together to the place next
morning, and after some asseveration that there was
no danger in it, we all resolved upon it. The morning
being come, lest we should alarm the servants, they
went under the pretence of seeing a field of wheat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
I took my horse and fetched a compass another way,
and so met at the stile we had appointed.</p>

<p>"Thence we all four walked leisurely into the
Quartils, and had passed above half the field before
the ghost made appearance. It then came over the
stile just before us, and moved with that swiftness that
by the time we had gone six or seven steps it passed
by. I immediately turned head and ran after it, with
the young man by my side; we saw it pass over the
stile by which we entered, but no farther. I stepped
upon the hedge at one place, he at another, but could
discern nothing; whereas I dare aver that the swiftest
horse in England could not have conveyed himself out
of sight in that short space of time. Two things I
observed in this day's appearance. (1) That a spaniel
dog, who followed the company unregarded, did bark
and run away as the spectrum passed by; whence it is
easy to conclude that it was not our fear or fancy which
made the apparition. (2) That the motion of the
spectrum was not by steps and moving of the feet, but
a kind of gliding, as children upon ice or a boat down
a swift river.</p>

<p>"But to proceed. This ocular evidence clearly convinced,
but strangely frightened, the old gentleman and
his wife, who knew this Dorothy Dingley in her lifetime,
were at her burial, and now plainly saw her
features in this present apparition.</p>

<p>"The next morning, being Thursday, I went out
very early by myself, and walked for about an hour's
space in meditation and prayer in the field next adjoining
the Quartils. Soon after five I stepped over the
stile into the disturbed field, and had not gone above
thirty or forty paces before the ghost appeared at the
farther stile. I spake to it with a loud voice, whereupon
it approached, but slowly, and when I came near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
it moved not. I spake again, and it answered, in a
voice neither very audible nor intelligible. I was not
in the least terrified, and therefore persisted until it
spake again and gave me satisfaction. But the work
could not be finished at this time; wherefore the same
evening, an hour after sunset, it met me again near
the same place, and after a few words on each side it
quickly vanished, and neither doth appear since, nor
ever will more to any man's disturbance. The discourse
in the morning lasted about a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"These things are true, and I know them to be so,
with as much certainty as eyes and ears can give me;
and until I can be persuaded that my senses do deceive
me about their proper object, and by that persuasion
deprive myself of the strongest inducement to believe
the Christian religion, I must and will assert that these
things in this paper are true."</p>

<p>It must be noted that Defoe in his printed account
omits the names of the family of Bligh, and that he
changes Dorothy Dingley into Mrs. Veale. Parson
Ruddle's original MS. is not in existence; it was
probably given to Defoe; but a copy is preserved made
by the son of the Rev. John Ruddle. Defoe was in
Launceston acting as a spy for the minister Harley in
August, 1705, and at that time he must have got hold of
the MS. After the signature "John Ruddle" at the
end of the narrative and the date is the sentence:
"This is a copy of w<sup>t</sup> I found written by my
father and signed John Ruddle. Taken by me,
William Ruddle," who had become vicar of South
Petherwin in 1695, and who became subsequently incumbent
also of S. Thomas-by-Launceston. This
copy bears the following attestation: "The readers
may observe y<sup>t</sup> I borrowed the remarkable passage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> grandson of John Ruddle who had it from his Uncle
William Ruddle. I think I'm exact in its transcription.
I well know the s<sup>d</sup> John Ruddle to have had (and I
daresay deserved) the character of a learned and eminent
Divine, and I also knew his son y<sup>e</sup> sayd William
Ruddle, a Divine whose character was so bright y<sup>t</sup> I
have no room to add to its lustre, and I hereby certify
y<sup>t</sup> I copyed this from y<sup>e</sup> very hand-writing of the sayd
William Ruddle. <i>Quinto die Februarii Anno Dni</i>,
1730. James Wakeman."</p>

<p>As Mr. Robbins says: "The completeness of the
body of proof of the Ruddle authorship leaves nothing
therefore to be desired."</p>

<p>Parson John Ruddle eventually became prebend of
Exeter, and held the vicarage of Altarnon along with
that of Launceston to his death.</p>

<p>Ruddle does not state that the boy Bligh was his
pupil at Launceston Free School, but one does not see
to what other school he can have gone, and the readiness
with which the lad opened his heart to him leads
to the notion that they had some previous acquaintance.
His way to Launceston would be over the common, on
which stand three barrows, to the road at Penfoot, where
he would strike the road. When he endeavoured to
avoid the ghost he took the Under Horse Road between
Quarry Park and the Nursery. The Quarry is still
visible with a pool in it, and a stream flowing into it
that rises on the moor where he saw the ghost, and
Under Horse Road still bears its name. The lad endeavoured
to take a short cut, though not as short as
across the Higher Brown Quartils, to reach the
Launceston road without having to go through South
Petherwin village.</p>

<p>Parson Ruddle does not give the Christian name of
the boy who saw the ghost, and we are thrown into
perplexity at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The "ancient gentleman" may have been Thomas
Bligh of Botathan, Esq., but he was aged no more
than fifty-three. Colonel Vivian's pedigree of the
Blighs in his <i>Visitation of Cornwall</i> is most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Thomas Bligh was buried at South Petherwin, April
10th, 1692. There is no entry in Vivian's pedigree of
Walter Bligh, gentleman, who was buried January 29th,
1667-8. Besides, there are many entries of an Edmund
Bligh and Katherine, his wife, and their children.
Thomas Bligh seems to have lived at one time at S.
Martin's-by-Looe. Dr. Lee in his <i>Glimpses of the
Supernatural</i> calls Dorothy Dingley, Dorothy Durant;
but on what authority I do not know. There is an
entry in the South Petherwin register of the burial of
Dorothy Durant, widow, 1st May, 1677, but according to
the story of the boy, Dorothy Dingley died in or about
1657. Unfortunately the South Petherwin registers do
not go back beyond August, 1656, but there is no entry in
them in 1656 or 1657 of the burial of Dorothy Dingley.</p>

<p>The Dingleys had been settled in Lezant and Linkinhorne
from 1577, and owned the place Hall in the latter
parish; but they had connections in Worcestershire;
and Dorothy was the youngest daughter of Francis
Dingley, baptized at Cropthorne, in the latter county, in
1596. She married Richard, son of George Durant, of
Blockly, Worcestershire. As no further trace of her
can be found in the register there, it is not unfair to
suppose that having kinsfolk in Cornwall she may have
journeyed there, and both were buried at South Petherwin,
Dorothy Durant, as already stated, in 1677. She
was then aged eighty-seven. She cannot have been the
ghost. But was the ghost that of her mother, a
Dorothy, who came to South Petherwin with her, and
died there about the year 1655? We cannot tell, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
do not know her mother's Christian name. Dr. Lee
clearly confused the Dorothy Durant with the Dorothy
Dingley, the ghost.</p>

<p>The Rev. P. T. Pulman, vicar of South Petherwin,
writes to me: "In December, 1896, a labourer died
here, aged seventy-two. For upwards of forty years he
had worked at Botathan. He told me that one of the
fields was called the Higher Brown Park (he did not
know the name of Quartells) until the field was ploughed
up. He told me there was a little path in it which they
called old Dorothy Dinglet's [<i>sic</i>] path, and that they
used to frighten the farm apprentices with stories about
her, but he had never met her himself. The farm has
been sold of recent years. There is a part of the old
house left used for a cider cellar. They call it Dorothy
Dingley's chamber."</p>

<p>The Rev. James Dingley was vicar of South Petherwin
from 1682 until 1695. He was born 1655, just ten
years before the apparition was seen by young Bligh.</p>

<h2>JOHN COUCH ADAMS,
ASTRONOMER</h2>

<p>Thomas Adams was a small tenant farmer
in the parish of Laneast, at Lidcott, renting
under John King Lethbridge, Esq., of Tregeare,
in Laneast. He married Tabitha
Knill Grylls, of Stoke Climsland, who inherited a very
little land in this latter parish.</p>

<p>Laneast lies on the Inny River&mdash;that is to say, the
village with its church occupies the southern slope of
Laneast Down that falls to this beautiful stream. But
Lidcott lies on the north side of the down, that rises to
eight hundred feet above the sea, one long swelling
mass of moor brown with heather, save when in August
it blushes like a modest girl, the heather all a-rose with
flower.</p>

<p>For three miles the highway from Camelford to
Launceston crosses this moor, one white strip drawn
through a mass of umber. At night the sheep that
grazed on the down would lie on the warm road, and
many a time have the coach-horses stumbled over them
in the night.</p>

<p>On this road, about the year 546, S. Samson was pursuing
his way from Padstow, where he had landed, to
Southill. He had with him a wagon drawn by horses
he had brought with him from Ireland, and as he proceeded
over the down he was aware of music and
dancing on the left-hand side of the road in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of Tregeare, and he found that the heathen people
were having a festival about a rude upright stone. He
stopped, harangued them, condemned their idolatrous
practice, and with his own hand cut a cross upon the
stone.</p>

<p>It is possible that this is the very rude stone cross
that still stands on the slope of the moor above Lidcott.</p>

<p>John Couch, son of Thomas Adams and Tabitha,
was born at Lidcott on 5th January, 1819, but no notice
of his baptism occurs in the parish register at Laneast.
Possibly he may have been taken to Egloskerry.</p>

<p>He received his early education at a dame's school in
his native parish; but was early employed by his father
to tend the sheep on Laneast Down. It was then and
there, on that great upland stretch of moor, with a vast
horizon about him, that, lying in the heather and looking
up into the sky, the mystery of the heavenly firmament
laid hold of him. He soon learned to distinguish
the planets from the fixed stars; he watched the rising
and the setting of the constellations, Charles's Wain
revolving nightly about the extremest star in what he
called the tail of the Plough; Orion with his twinkling
belt and curved sword, "louting on one knee."</p>

<p>To the west and south stood up against the evening
glow the ridge of the Bodmin Moors, Brown Willy,
Rough Tor, Kilmar, and Caradon. To the north
nothing interrupted the view, for there lay the vast
Atlantic; and on stormy nights the boom of its waves
might be heard from that highway over the down. To
the east and south-east the far-off range of Dartmoor,
blue as a vein in a girl's temple, on a summer day.</p>

<p>Many a chiding did John Couch get from his father
for being out late at night upon the moor; the old
farmer was unable to understand what the attraction
was which drew the lad from home and from his supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to be out, either lying on the road or leaning against
the old granite cross, star-gazing. Happily Mrs. Adams
had a simple book on astronomy that had belonged to
her father, and this her son Jack devoured, and now he
began to understand something of the motions of the
heavenly bodies. He established a sundial on the
window-sill of the parlour, and constructed out of
cardboard an apparatus for taking the altitude of the sun.</p>

</div>

<p>His father, finding that his inclinations were not for
farm work, sent him to study with a relative of his
mother, the Rev. P. Couch Grylls, who had a school
at Devonport, but later moved to Saltash. All his
spare time John Couch spent in reading astronomical
works, which he obtained from the library of the
Mechanics' Institute; he drew maps of constellations
and computed celestial phenomena. A day long to be
remembered by him as one of the happiest in his life
was that in which he obtained a look through a telescope
at the moon. "Why," he exclaimed, "they
have Brown Willy and Rough Tor up there!"</p>

<p>His account of a solar eclipse viewed at Devonport
through a small spyglass got into print in a London
paper. After three weeks' watching he caught sight
of Halley's Comet on 16th October, 1839.</p>

<p>His father now with considerable effort arranged to
send him to the University of Cambridge, and he
entered S. John's College as a poor sizar in October,
1839; he graduated as Senior Wrangler in 1843, and
was first Smith's prizeman, and soon elected Fellow and
appointed tutor of his college.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-two he was struck with the disturbance
in the course of the planet Uranus, and he
perceived that this must be due to the attraction possessed
by some other planet, as yet unseen and unsuspected,
that produced these perturbations. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
this led to the discovery of the planet Neptune shall
be told from the <i>Reminiscences</i> of Caroline Fox:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1847, October 7th.&mdash;Dined at Carclew, and spent a
very interesting evening. We met Professor Adams,
the Bullers, the Lord of the Isles, and others. Adams is
a quiet-looking man, with a broad forehead, a mild face,
and an amiable and expressive mouth. I sat by him at
dinner, and by general and dainty approaches got at the
subject on which one most wished to hear him speak.
He began very blushingly, but went on to talk in most
delightful fashion, with large and luminous simplicity,
of some of the vast mathematical facts with which he is
so conversant. The idea of the reversed method of
reasoning, from an unknown to a known, with reference
to astronomical problems dawned on him when
an undergraduate, with neither time nor mathematics
to work it out. The opposite system had always before
been adopted. He, in common with many others,
conceived that there must be a planet to account for the
disturbances of Uranus; and when he had time he set to
work at the process, in deep, quiet faith that the fact was
there, and that his hitherto untried mathematical path
was the one which must reach it; that there were no
anomalies in the universe, but that, even here, and now,
they could be explained and included in a higher law.
The delight of working it out was far more than any
notoriety could give, for his love of pure truth is evidently
intense, an inward necessity, unaffected by all
the penny trumpets of the world. Well, at length he
fixed his point in space, and sent his mathematical
evidence to Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who locked the
papers up in his desk, partly from carelessness, partly
from incredulity, for it seemed to him impossible that
a man whose name was unknown to him should strike
out a new path in mathematical science with any success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Moreover, his theory was, that if there were a
planet, it would not be discovered for one hundred and
sixty years; that is, until two revolutions of Uranus
had been accomplished. Then came Leverrier's equally
original, though many months younger, demonstration;
Gull's immediate verification of it by observation;
and then the other astronomers were all astir.
Professor Adams speaks of those about whom the English
scientific world is so indignant in a spirit of Christian
philosophy, exactly in keeping with the mind of a
man who has discovered a planet. He speaks with
warmest admiration of Leverrier, specially of his exhaustive
method of making out the orbits of the comets,
imagining and disproving all tracks but the right one&mdash;a
work of infinite labour. If the observer could make
out distinctly but a very small part of a comet's orbit,
the mathematician would be able to prove what its
course had been through all time. They enjoyed being
a good deal together at the British Association Meeting
at Oxford, though it was unfortunate for the intercourse
of the fellow-workers that one could not speak
French nor the other English. He had met with very
little mathematical sympathy, except from Challis, of
the Cambridge Observatory; but when his result was
announced there was noise enough and to spare. He
was always fond of star-gazing and speculation, and is
already on the watch for another planet. Burnard told
us that when Professor Adams came from Cambridge
to visit his relatives in Cornwall he was employed to
sell sheep for his father at a fair. He is a most good
son and neighbour, and watchful in the performance of
small acts of thoughtful kindness."</p>

<p>"1863, July 2nd.&mdash;Have just returned from a visit to
Professor Adams at Cambridge. He is so delightful
in the intervals of business, enjoying all things, large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and small, with a boyish zest. He showed and explained
the calculating machine (French, not Babbage's),
which saves him much in time and brain, as it
can multiply or divide ten figures accurately. We
came upon an admirable portrait of him at S. John's
College, before he accepted a Pembroke Fellowship and
migrated thither."</p>

<p>The first mention of the name of Adams as the discoverer
of Neptune was by Sir John Herschel, in the
<i>Athenæum</i>, on October 3rd, 1845. And a letter from
Professor Challis to that journal on 17th October
described in detail the transactions between Adams,
Airy, and himself. Naturally enough the French were
highly incensed at the notion that an obscure Englishman
had forestalled Leverrier in the discovery, and
Airy himself was annoyed at his own negligence in
not looking into the memoir by Adams, and took up the
matter with some personal feeling. It was certainly
startling to realize that the Astronomer Royal had had
in his possession data that would have enabled the
planet to be discovered nearly a year before Leverrier
had, by a different course of argument and calculation,
arrived at the conclusion that there existed a planet
which was the disturbing element in the orbit of Uranus.
As to Adams himself, he had not a particle of conceit
and pride in him; he did not care to have his name
proclaimed as the discoverer. Forty years later, he
said simply and characteristically that all he had wished
for was that English astronomers to whom he had communicated
the result of his calculations, pointing out
the precise spot in the sky where a planet was to be
found, would have taken the trouble to turn their telescopes
upon that point and discover the planet, so
that England might have had the full credit of the
discovery.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>His long-suppressed investigation was not laid
before the Royal Astronomical Society till November
13th, 1846.</p>

<p>The publication, of course, stirred up much controversy,
and the scientific world was divided into
Adamite and anti-Adamite factions.</p>

<p>Adams refused knighthood in 1847, and declined
the office of Astronomer Royal on Airy's retirement in
1881.</p>

<p>John Couch had a brother, William Grylls, also a
man of some eminence in the scientific world. He
was born at Lidcott 12th February, 1836, and became
Professor of Natural Philosophy and of Astronomy in
King's College, London.</p>

<p>I was wont, when at Cambridge, to meet John Couch
Adams at Professor Challis', and also at the house of
the Rev. Harvey Goodwin, afterwards Bishop of Carlisle.
Professor Adams took some notice of me, as coming from
his neighbourhood, though not on the Cornish side of
the Tamar. He was a small man, as simple as a child in
many things. Indeed, he struck me forcibly by his
great modesty and sweetness of manner. He loved a
joke, and would laugh heartily over the very smallest.
He loved children, and would play with them in their
little games with infinite zest. Professor Glaisher,
whom I also knew, wrote of him: "Adams was a
man of learning as well as a man of science. He was
an omnivorous reader, and his memory was exact and
retentive. There were few subjects upon which he was
not possessed of accurate information. Botany, geology,
history, and divinity, all had their share of his care and
attention."</p>

<p>He was always happy to return to his humble
father's farm; and after he was a noted man, on one of
these occasions the old man sent him into Launceston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with a drove of sheep to sell them in the market. He
complied cheerfully, but how he succeeded in selling
them I have not heard. This is the incident alluded to
by Caroline Fox given above.</p>

<p>"The honours showered upon him," wrote Dr.
Donald MacAlister, "left him as they found him&mdash;modest,
gentle, and sincere." He was not a man who
ever asserted himself.</p>

<p>He married in 1863 Eliza, daughter of Haliday
Bruce, of Dublin. He died of a sudden illness on
January 21st, 1892, and was buried in S. Giles' Churchyard,
Cambridge.</p>

<p>Portraits were taken of him by Mogford in 1851,
and by Herkomer in 1888; both are in the Combination-room
of St. John's College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>A biographical notice of him was prefixed by Professor
Glaisher to his scientific works, edited by
W. G. Adams, in 1896-8.</p>

<h2>DANIEL GUMB</h2>


<p>All that is really known of this eccentric character
is found in a letter of J. B. to Richard
Polwhele, dated September, 1814. His
correspondent says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Daniel Gumb was born in the parish of Linkinhorne,
in Cornwall, about the commencement of the last
century, and was bred a stone-cutter. In the early
part of his life he was remarkable for his love of reading
and a degree of reserve even exceeding what is
observable in persons of studious habits. By close
application Daniel acquired, even in his youth, a considerable
stock of mathematical knowledge, and, in
consequence, became celebrated throughout the adjoining
parishes. Called by his occupation to hew blocks
of granite on the neighbouring commons, and especially
in the vicinity of that great natural curiosity
called the Cheesewring, he discovered near this spot
an immense block, whose upper surface was an inclined
plane. This, it struck him, might be made the
roof of a habitation such as he desired; sufficiently
secluded from the busy haunts of men to enable him to
pursue his studies without interruption, whilst it was
contiguous to the scene of his daily labour. Immediately
Daniel went to work, and cautiously excavating
the earth underneath, to nearly the extent of the stone
above, he obtained a habitation which he thought
sufficiently commodious. The sides he lined with
stone, cemented with lime, whilst a chimney was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
by perforating the earth at one side of the roof. From
the elevated spot on which stood this extraordinary
dwelling could be seen Dartmoor and Exmoor on the
east, Hartland on the north, the sea and the port of
Plymouth on the south, and S. Austell and Bodmin Hills
on the west, with all the intermediate beautiful scenery.
The top of the rock which roofed his house served
Daniel for an observatory, where at every favourable
opportunity he watched the motions of the heavenly
bodies, and on the surface of which, with his chisel, he
carved a variety of diagrams, illustrative of the most
difficult problems of Euclid, etc. These he left behind
him as evidences of the patience and ingenuity with
which he surmounted the obstacles that his station in
life had placed in the way of his mental improvement.</p>

<p>"But the choice of his house and the mode in which
he pursued his studies were not his only eccentricities.
His house became his chapel also; and he was never
known to descend from the craggy mountain on which
it stood, to attend his parish church or any other place
of worship.</p>

<p>"Death, which alike seizes on the philosopher and
the fool, at length found out the retreat of Daniel Gumb,
and lodged him in a house more narrow than that which
he had dug for himself."</p>

<p>Bond in his <i>Topographical and Historical Sketches of
the Boroughs of East and West Looe</i>, 1873, describes the
habitation of Daniel Gumb as seen by him in 1802:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we reached Cheesewring&mdash;our guide first
led us to the house of Daniel Gumb (a stone-cutter),
cut by him out of a solid rock of granite. This artificial
cavern may be about twelve feet deep and not quite so
broad; the roof consists of one flat stone of many tons
weight; supported by the natural rock on one side,
and by pillars of small stones on the other. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Gumb formed this last support is not easily conceived.
We entered with hesitation lest the covering should be
our gravestone. On the right-hand side of the door
is 'D. Gumb,' with a date engraved 1735 (or 3). On
the upper part of the covering stone, channels are cut
to carry off the rain, probably to cause it to fall into
a bucket for his use; there is also engraved on it some
geometrical device formed by Gumb, as the guide told
us, who also said that Gumb was accounted a pretty
sensible man. I have no hesitation in saying he must
have been a pretty eccentric character to have fixed on
this place for his habitation; but here he dwelt for
several years with his wife and children, several of
whom were born and died here. His calling was that
of a stone-cutter, and he fixed himself on a spot where
materials could be met with to employ a thousand men
for a thousand years."</p>

   <p class="caption2">THE CHEESE-WRING</p>
</div>

<p>The Rev. Robert S. Hawker wrote an account of
Daniel Gumb for <i>All the Year Round</i> in 1866, and this
has been reprinted in <i>Footsteps of Former Men in
Cornwall</i>.</p>

<p>He pretends that when he visited the Cheesewring
in 183-, there still existed fragments of Daniel Gumb's
"thoughts and studies still treasured up in the existing
families of himself and his wife." And he gives
transcripts from these, and also from what must have
been a diary. But Mr. Hawker embroidered facts with
so much detail drawn from his own fancy, that his statements
have to be taken with a very large pinch of salt.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, in his justification, that his
stories of Cornish Characters were intended as magazine
articles to amuse, but without any purpose of
having them regarded as strictly biographical and historical.
They were brief historical romances, and were
not intended to be taken seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>I will give but one quotation, and the reader can
judge for himself therefrom whether it does not look
like an extract "made in Morwenstow." Mr. Hawker
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the fly-leaves of an old account book the
following strange statement appears: 'June 23rd, 1764.
To-day, at bright noon, I looked up and saw all at once
a stranger standing on the turf, just above my block.
He was dressed like an old picture I remember in the
windows of S. Neot's Church, in a long brown garment,
with a girdle; and his head was uncovered and grizzled
with long hair. He spoke to me, and he said in a low,
clear voice, "Daniel, that work is hard!" I wondered
that he should know my name, and I answered, "Yes,
sir; but I am used to it and don't mind it, for the sake
of the faces at home." Then he said, sounding his
words like a psalm, "Man goeth forth to his work and
to his labour until the evening. When will it be night
with Daniel Gumb?" I began to feel queer; it seemed
to me that there was something awful about the unknown
man. I even shook. Then he said again,
"Fear nothing. The happiest man in all the earth is he
that wins his daily bread by his daily sweat, if he will
but fear God and do man no wrong." I bent down
my head like any one dumbfounded, and I greatly
wondered who this strange appearance could be. He
was not like a preacher, for he looked me full in the
face; nor a bit like a parson, for he seemed very meek
and kind. I began to think it was a spirit, only such
ones always come by night, and here was I at noonday
and at work. So I made up my mind to drop my
hammer and step up and ask his name right out. But
when I looked up he was gone, and that clear out of
my sight, on the bare, wide moor, suddenly.'"</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, no trace or tidings of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
notes so treasured up by the family are to be found in
the parish of Linkinhorne, to which Gumb and his wife
belonged.</p>

<p>In the second place, Mr. Hawker makes Daniel
remark that his mysterious visitant was not like a
Dissenting preacher because he looked him straight in
the face, and this is significantly like a remark Hawker
often made with regard to these gentry.</p>

<p>Another of these pretended notes refers to the finding
of a fossil fish embedded in granite. This alone
suffices to wake suspicion that the extracts are not
genuine. Fossils never have been found in granite,
and never will be. But Hawker himself did not know
this, as he was totally ignorant of the first principles
of geology.</p>

<h2>LAURENCE BRADDON</h2>


<p>Laurence Braddon, second son of Captain
William Braddon, of Treworgy, in S. Gennys,
was called to the bar of the Middle Temple,
and worked at his profession diligently. He
entered Parliament in 1651, but did not attract special
notice till the occasion of the suicide of the Earl of
Essex in the Tower, in 1683.</p>

<p>The people of England had been, and still were,
greatly troubled about the succession to the throne, in
the event of the death of Charles II. They had no
mind to have the throne occupied by a Popish prince,
and several plots were hatched to prevent such a contingency.
Monmouth, with Lord Essex, Shaftesbury,
Lord Howard of Escrick, Russell, Algernon Sidney,
and John Hampden, held meetings to found an association
to agitate and compel the King to assemble Parliament,
to take measures to secure a Protestant succession
and the exclusion of the Duke of York. On other
points they disagreed. Monmouth hoped to have his
legitimacy established and to secure the crown for his
own brows. Sidney and Essex were for the establishment
of a commonwealth. Russell and Hampden
intended only the exclusion of the Duke. As to Lord
Howard, he was a man of no principle, and his sole
desire was to fish in troubled waters and get out of
them what he could.</p>

<p>More desperate spirits schemed plans of assassination,
and a plot was formed for murdering Charles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Duke of York as they passed the Rye House on the
road from London to Newmarket, but there is no
evidence that the noble schemers had any knowledge of
the Rye House Plot.</p>

<p>Both projects were betrayed, and though they were
wholly distinct from one another, the cruel ingenuity of
the Crown lawyers blended them into one.</p>

<p>The Earl of Shaftesbury fled to the Continent;
Monmouth absconded; Russell was committed to the
Tower; Howard, who had concealed himself in a
chimney, was drawn forth by the heels, and to secure
his neck betrayed Essex, Sidney, and Hampden, who
were all committed to the Tower.</p>

<p>Several of the conspirators in the Rye House Plot
were sentenced to death and at once executed. From
their confessions it appeared that the conspiracy had
wide ramifications, and that a scheme of insurrection
throughout the country had been formed, and that steps
had been taken to organize it.</p>

<p>On the day upon which Lord Russell was brought to
trial the Earl of Essex was found in the closet of his
chamber with his throat cut, and this but just after
a visit to the Tower by the King with the Duke of
York.</p>

<p>An inquest was at once held, at which it was
shown that Lord Essex was a man of a despondent
temper, that he had been lately in a lugubrious
mood, and in the depths of melancholy; and evidence
was conclusive that he had cut his own throat with
a razor. The jury accordingly found a verdict of
<i>felo de se</i>.</p>

<p>Now it so fell out that on the following Sunday
Laurence Braddon went to visit a Mr. Evans, of the Custom
House, at his country house at Wanstead, in Essex,
where was also a Mr. Halstead, and Evans was telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Halstead that he had heard from a kinsman of his
named Edwards, also in the Customs, that his boy had
been in the Tower yard on the morning of the death of
Lord Essex, and that he had seen a hand thrust out of
that nobleman's window, and a razor stained with blood
thrown down on the pavement of the yard. Next
moment a maid-servant wearing a white hood had
run out, secured the razor and carried it within, and
that he had heard cries from within of "Murder!
Murder!"</p>

<p>Braddon listened, walking up and down the room, as
Evans told this story. He was greatly excited by it,
and thought that it pointed to a murder having been
committed, and that probably at the instigation of the
Duke of York.</p>

<p>Accordingly Braddon went next day to the quay
and got Evans and Edwards to meet him at the "Star"
public-house and repeat the story. It seemed that
Edwards had two boys who were in Merchant Taylors'
School, and that one of their sisters was married and
living in the Tower. On the morning of the death of
Lord Essex the lads were on their way to school, when,
passing the Tower, they heard that the King and the
Duke of York were in it, whereupon the younger, an
urchin of twelve or thirteen, gave his brother the slip,
and ran in to see the King and the Duke. After they
had departed he remained in the yard playing chuck-farthing
with other boys, when he saw a hand thrust
forth from a window and throw a bloody razor into the
court, and after that a maid or woman in a white hood
and stuff coat took it up and went in, and then he
heard a noise as of "Murder!" cried out. Braddon then
went to the house of Edwards to question the boy, who
prevaricated. Braddon believed that the child's mother
and sister had been at him, telling him that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
likely to get them all into trouble if he persisted in
his tale, and urged by them, professed that he had told
a lie.</p>

<p>The matter became common talk on the quay and
the purlieus of the Tower.</p>

<p>Braddon had no great difficulty in finding a little
girl named Jane Lodeman, aged thirteen, who was in
the same tale. This is what he took down:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jane Lodeman was in the Tower on Friday morning,
13th July last, and standing almost over against
the late Earl of Essex's lodging window, she saw a
hand cast a razor out of my lord's window, and
immediately upon this she heard shrieks, and that
there was a soldier by my lord's door, who cried out to
those within the house that somebody should come
and take up a razor which was thrown out of the
window, whereupon there came a maid with a white
hood out of the house, but who took up the razor she
can't tell."</p>

<p>Dated 8th August, 1683.</p>

<p>On July 20th Braddon had gone to Whitehall before
he had obtained this corroborative evidence, and had
laid information before the King and Council, and produced
a written deposition as to what the boy Edwards
had said he had seen; but the boy's sister deposed
that Mr. Laurence Braddon had forced her brother to
sign it. Soon after Braddon had taken this step, he
heard a rumour that the fact of the violent death of the
Earl of Essex had been known and discussed in Frome
Selwood the same day, and he hurried off to make
inquiries into this. But on reaching Salisbury he was
arrested, thrown into prison, and brought back to
London. Another gentleman, a Mr. Speeke, had also
been spreading the report that Lord Essex had been
foully murdered, and it was hinted that the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
York, if not the King, had ordered the assassination.
Speeke also was arrested.</p>

<p>Narcissus Luttrell's account of the death of Essex is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1683, 13th July.&mdash;"About nine in the morning, the
Earl of Essex, prisoner in the Tower of London,
upon account of this new plott, did most barbarously
cut his own throat from one ear to the other with a
razor. What occasioned it is doubtfull: some say, the
sense of his guilt; others, the shame for being accused
of such a crime, when his father, the Lord Capell, died
for his loyalty to the late King; however, the coroner's
jury have satt on his body, and found him <i>felo de se</i>,
tho' some stick not to say 'tis impossible he should
murther himself in so barbarous a manner; and his
Majesty hath been pleased to give his goods, which were
forfeited by his killing himself, to his son."</p>

<p>On November 6th he says: "Mr. Speak was brought
to the Court of King's Bench, and charged with two
informations: the 1st, for saying the King was as great
a Papist as the Duke of York; that the Duke durst not
doe what he did but that the King did animate him;
that what Pilkington had formerly said of the Duke of
York was true; with much other such scandalous stuff;
and 2nd was for sayeing that the Earl of Essex was
killed and murdered by those that attended on him in
the Tower; to both these he pleaded Not Guilty."</p>

<p>1683-4, February 7th.&mdash;"Mr. Lawrence Braddon
and Mr. Hugh Speke were tried at the Court of King's
Bench, by a jury of Middlesex, upon an information
reciting the commitment of the late Earl of Essex to
the Tower for treason in conspiring the death of the
King, etc., and that the 13th July last he cut his own
throat, and was found <i>felo de se</i> by the coroner's inquisition;
the said Braddon and Speke did conspire by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
writing and otherwise, to spread a false and scandalous
report, that the said Earl was murdered by some persons
about him, and endeavoured to suborn witnesses to
testifye the same. The evidence for the King, was first,
the warder of the Tower, who testified as to his Lordship's
commitment; then the coroner, and the inquisition
taken before him, whereby his Lordship was found
<i>felo de se</i>, was read; then the particular evidence
against Mr. Braddon was, by severall persons, how
busy and sollicitous he was to take persons' informations,
and to examine a little child about ten years old, about
a discourse that ran through the town that a bloody
razor was thrown out of his Lordship's window; and
that the cry of Murder was heard; and that a servant
maid came presently out of the house of the Lord of
Essex, and took up the razor, and carried it in; and that
then it was said the Lord of Essex had killed himself.
Then the severall informations Braddon had taken in
writing relating to this matter were read, and some of
the informants themselves examined, whose testimony
much differ'd from their informations, then severall testified
the confident and strange discourse this Braddon
frequently us'd concerning the matter. The evidence
against Mr. Speke was only a letter writt by him to
Sir Robert Atkins th' elder, and carried by Mr. Braddon,
but was seized about him when he was going
thither, which contained severall expressions in commendation
of Mr. Braddon and his zeale, with reflexions
on this matter; then the evidence was given
of his Lordship's cutting his own throat with a razor,
which was proved by his own servant, a Frenchman;
by the warder, by the centinell, and by Capt. Hawley.
The defendants' proof was, first, Braddon pretended he
did nothing but out of zeale to have the truth come
out: then he call'd some witnesses to prove that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
was a discourse of the Lord of Essex's being killed,
and a razor thrown out, before he concern'd himself in
it. Speke had little to say against the letter, but own'd
it to be his hand; so that the jury, after a little while,
agreed of their verdict, and found the defendant
Braddon guilty of all that was laid in the information,
and the defendant Speke guilty of all except the conspiring
to suborn witnesses.</p>

<p>"'Twas strange any man should concern himself in
an affair of this moment on the information of a boy
ten years old, who had denied all after he had confess'd
it, and did at his tryall, and make all this rent that was
about it."</p>

<p>April 21st, 1684.&mdash;"Mr. Laurence Braddon and Mr.
Hugh Speke, convicted last term upon an endeavour
to lay the murder of the late Earl of Essex upon the
Government, were brought to the Court of King's
Bench to receive their judgments; which was, that
Braddon should pay a fine of £2000, and Speke £1000
to the King; that they find sureties for their good
behaviour during their lives, and be committed to the
King's Bench prison till they doe so."</p>

<p>Hugh Speke, who was tried along with Laurence
Braddon, was an inveterate plotter. Macaulay thus
describes him: "Hugh Speke (was) a young man of
good family, but of a singularly base and depraved
nature. His love of mischief and of dark and crooked
ways amounted almost to madness. To cause confusion
without being found out was his business and his pastime;
and he had a rare skill in using honest enthusiasts
as the instruments of his cold-blooded malice."</p>

<p>Referring to the case of Braddon, Macaulay adds:
"He had attempted, by means of one of his puppets,
to fasten on Charles and James the crime of murdering
Essex in the Tower. On this occasion the agency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Speke had been traced; and though he succeeded in
throwing the greater part of the blame on his dupe, he
had not escaped with impunity."</p>

<p>He was certainly a clever scoundrel, for he managed
to cover up most of his traces in the affair of the
charge of the murder of Essex.</p>

<p>Braddon was sincere, while Speke was not. Braddon
was convinced that a murder had been committed, and
he had not a well-balanced mind to weigh evidence.
Speke cared nothing whether crime had been committed
or not so long as he could disturb men's minds
with a suspicion that one had been committed, and that
by the King's brother and heir presumptive to the
Crown.</p>

<p>The evidence produced by Laurence Braddon was
practically worthless. He had but the word of two
little children, and the boy had retracted and acknowledged
that he had told lies. As to the fact of the
death of Lord Essex being known at Frome on the 13th,
showing that the murder had been premeditated and
was part of a widely ramified scheme of the Papists, it
was shown that nothing was known there of it till many
days later.</p>

<p>The evidence for the King was Bomeny, the valet de
chambre of Lord Essex. He stated that the Earl had
long nails, and that morning had asked for a penknife
so as to pare them. Bomeny had commissioned a footman,
William Turner, to get one, and bring it along
with some provisions ordered for the Earl's breakfast.
Turner brought the provisions, but had forgotten
about the penknife, whereupon Lord Essex began to
cut his nails with his razor, and the footman was again
despatched for a penknife. Just then the King and the
Duke of York arrived at the Tower, and there was
great bustle in the yard, and Bomeny left the Earl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
room. When he met the footman with the knife he
returned, but not finding Lord Essex in his chamber,
he tried to open the closet door, when he found that
there was an obstruction. Somewhat alarmed, he ran
to Russell, the warder, whose door was almost opposite
on the same staircase, and both went to the closet,
and found Lord Essex lying in it with his throat cut
and his feet against the door.</p>

<p>Russell corroborated this evidence, and added that
no one could possibly ascend the stair and enter Lord
Essex's chamber without his knowledge. The soldier,
Lloyd, who acted as sentinel at the entrance to the
Earl's quarters, testified that there was no truth in the
children's tale about the razor, and that no maid had
issued from the door to pick one up.</p>

<p>It was further established that the closet window did
not look into the main yard, and was so arranged that
a hand could not be passed out of it.</p>

<p>Judge Jeffreys conducted the investigation, and that
in a most unseemly manner. Apparently he was drunk
at the time, and was so confused that he was not able to
follow the evidence. He browbeat the witnesses in
the most offensive way.</p>

<p>On November 6th, 1684, a French Protestant refugee,
named Borleau, was indicted for selling a scandalous
book called <i>L'Esprit de Monsieur Arnaud</i>, in which he
declared that the Earl of Essex had not cut his own
throat, but had been foully murdered. He pleaded
guilty, and the King graciously allowed him to be
fined only 6s. 8d., and to be discharged without paying
his fees. There was most certainly fish made of one
and fowl of another.</p>

<p>Again, in December of the same year a book appeared
entitled <i>An Enquiry about the Barbarous
Murder of the Earl of Essex</i>, that was vended surreptitiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and a broadside written by Colonel Danvers,
giving the evidence that he was murdered, was thrown
in at open doors and distributed in the streets of London.
A hundred pounds was offered for the apprehension of
Danvers. As to the book, it was from the pen of
Laurence Braddon, and was later, when it could be
done safely, acknowledged by him. On January 23rd,
1684-5, a Mr. Henry Baker pleaded guilty to an information
for using scandalous words about the Duke of
York, and at the same time a printer, Norden, did the
same to an indictment for publishing the "scandalous
libell in vindication of the lord of Essex." And on
February 3rd one of the jury at the inquest, Launcelot
Colston by name, was had up before King's Bench on
a charge of having said that he did not believe that the
Earl had cut his throat, for he could not have done so
himself in the way in which he was found. Norden
was sentenced to pay 200 marks, and to stand in the
pillory at Ratcliffe, and to be bound to his good behaviour
for seven years, and be committed to prison till
this was done.</p>

<p>In 1685, on the landing of the Duke of Monmouth,
in the Proclamation he published, he charged King
James with the murder of Essex, with his own hand.</p>

<p>In January, 1689, a Captain Hawley, Major Whitley,
and some two or three more were imprisoned
for maintaining that Essex had not committed suicide.
But this was at the moment when all power was slipping
out of the hands of King James II; the Prince of
Orange came to the throne, and on February 23rd
a Captain Holland was arrested and thrown into prison
on the charge of having been concerned in the murder
of the Earl, and this was followed by numerous other
arrests. But the prison-doors were thrown open for
Laurence Braddon to issue forth and recommence his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
accusations of murder. He republished the "Enquiry
into and Detection of the Barbarous Murther of the late
Earl of Essex; or a Vindication of that Noble Person
from the Guilt and Infamy of having Destroyed
himself."</p>

<p>Even before the throne, vacated by King James, had
been filled by the Prince of Orange, the Lords had
appointed a committee to examine into the truth of the
frightful stories circulated relative to the death of Essex.
The committee, which consisted wholly of zealous
Whigs, continued its inquiries till all reasonable men
were convinced that he had fallen by his own hand, and
till Lady Essex, his brother, and his most intimate
friends requested that the investigation might be pursued
no further. That under Judge Jeffreys had been
open to suspicion, this could not. But nothing would
alter the persuasion of Braddon that this was a case of
murder.</p>

<p>Next year, 1690, he came out with a fresh pamphlet,
"Essex's Innocency and Honour Vindicated, or Murther,
Subornation, Perjury, and Oppression, justly
charged on the Murtherers of that Noble and True
Patriot Arthur (late) Earl of Essex," etc.</p>

<p>It had become a matter of party feeling, and it was
held by all true Protestants to be their duty to believe
in the murder, so as to blacken the character of
James II. The evidence, however, was too poor to
convince a cool-minded man like Bishop Burnet, and
in his <i>History of His Own Times</i> he spoke of Essex
having cut his own throat. Thereupon Laurence
Braddon resumed his pen and published an attack on
the Bishop: "Bishop Burnet's History charged with
great partiality and misrepresentations, to make the
present and future ages believe that Arthur, Earl of
Essex, in 1683, murdered himselfe, with observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
upon the suppos'd poysoning of King Charles the
Second," 1724.</p>

<p>In 1695 Braddon was appointed solicitor to the wine-licensing
office, with a salary of £100 per annum.</p>

<p>In one point Braddon showed great perspicuity and
good feeling. In 1717 he published a pamphlet
entitled "The Miseries of the Poor, a National Sin and
Shame"; and when his scheme for the relief of the poor
had been animadverted upon unfavourably, in 1722, he
answered these objections in another tractate: "Particular
answers to the most material objections made to
the proposal humbly presented to His Majesty for
relieving, reforming, and employing all the poor of
Great Britain," 1722.</p>

<p>Laurence Braddon died on Sunday, 29th November,
1724.</p>

<p>The Braddons must have been a family of some consequence
in S. Gennys, although their arms and
pedigree are not recorded in the Heralds' Visitations.
At the trial of Laurence, it was stated that his father's
income from his property was fully £800 per annum.
Laurence derived his fiery Protestantism from his father,
who had been a Parliamentarian officer of some distinction
in the Civil War. His father is buried in the
chancel of S. Gennys, and some verses are inscribed
on the ledgerstone, beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In war and peace I bore command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both gun and sword I wore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The arms borne by the family are: <i>Sable</i>, a bend
lozengy, <i>arg.</i>&mdash;arms that in their beautiful simplicity
proclaim their antiquity.</p>

<p>The old mansion of the Braddons in S. Gennys has
been pulled down and a modern farm-house erected on
the site.</p>

<h2>THOMASINE BONAVENTURA</h2>


<p>Week S. Mary stands in a treeless wind-swept
situation, 530 feet above the sea, near
the source of two small streams rising in
the desolate downs to the south, which
unite their waters at Langford, and have sawn for
themselves deep clefts that are well wooded. At a
remote period this district must have been the scene
of contests, for it is studded with earthworks. There
was a castle at Week, but camps also crowning a height
in Westwood and in Swannacott Wood; and Week
S. Mary with its castle stood aloft, defended by one of
these on each side. Formerly there was not so much
enclosed land as there is at present; but it was precisely
the moorland that extended over so large a
portion of the parish that constituted its wealth, for on
this waste pastured vast flocks of sheep, whose fleeces
were in request at a time when wool was the staple
industry in the West of England.</p>

<p>The ridge of bare, uplifted, carboniferous rock and
clay, cold and bleak, was formerly scantily provided
with roads, and with homesteads few and far between;
and to guide the traveller through the waste, certain
churches with lofty towers were erected on
high ground&mdash;Pancrasweek, Holsworthy, Bridgerule,
Week S. Mary&mdash;to enable him to make his way across
country from one to the other. A farm or a manor-house
nestled in a combe, sheltered from the wind,
from the sea, and the driving rain; but farmer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
squire drew their wealth from the sheep on the uplands,
which were moreover strewn, as they still are, with
barrows, under which lie the dead of the Bronze and
Stone ages.</p>

<p>Davies Gilbert absurdly derives the name of the
place from the Cornish, and makes it signify "sweet."
No more unsuitable epithet could have been applied.
It signifies <i>vicus</i>, a village or hamlet, and is found also
at Pancrasweek, Germansweek, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the village are still to be seen the remains of the
old school and chantry founded by Thomasine Bonaventura,
a shepherd girl, native of the place, whose
story is told by Carew and by Hall; and from them
we take it.</p>

<p>Thomasine was born about the year 1450, in the
reign of Henry VI, and her father was a small farmer
who had his flock of sheep pasturing on the wild waste
common-lands. Thomasine watched it, and spun from
her distaff. Above the desolate moors to the south-west
stood up blue against the sky the rugged height
of Brown Willy, crowned by its mighty cairns; to the
west and south-west stretched the Atlantic, into which
the evening sun went down in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>One day a London merchant, a dealer in wool, came
riding over the moor; probably from Tintagel or
Forrabury, and making direct for Week S. Mary tower,
when he passed a barrow on which sat the shepherd
girl spinning, the breeze from the sea blowing her
dark hair about, singing some old ballad, but ever
keeping her eye on her father's sheep. Behind him
trailed a line of horses laden with the packs of wool
that he had purchased, led by his men. He halted to
speak to the girl, probably to learn from her where he
might best ford the stream in the valley below. She
answered, and he was pleased with her intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and not less with her beauty. He inquired who she
was, what was her name, and what the circumstances
of her parents. To all these questions she gave prompt
and direct answers. Then, still more taken with her,
he asked Thomasine whether she would accompany
him to London, to be servant to his wife, and he offered
her good wages and kind treatment. She replied, with
caution, that she was under the guardianship of her
father and mother, and that she could not accept his
proposal without their consent.</p>

<p>Thereupon the merchant rode on, and upon reaching
Week S. Mary inquired for the house of
the parents of Thomasine and laid his offer before
them. When they hesitated, he referred them to
his customers.</p>

<p>The parents, no doubt, were highly elated at being
able to get their daughter into a situation in London,
where all the streets were paved with gold. But it
may well be doubted whether they dreamt of what was
in store for her.</p>

<p>So she parted from her parents, certainly with many
tears on her part, and earnest injunctions from father
and mother to conduct herself in a modest and obedient
manner.</p>

<p>Now these wool merchants and clothiers were men
of mighty repute and good substance in the land. In
Thomas Deloney's delightful <i>Pleasant Historie of
Thomas of Reading</i>, 1600, we read: "Among all crafts
this was the onely chiefe, for that it was the chiefest
merchandize, by the which our Country became famous
throwout all Nations. And it was verily thought that
the one halfe of the people in the land lived in those
dayes thereby, and in such good sort, that in the
Commonwealth there were few or no beggars at all:
poore people, whom God lightly blessed with most children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
did by meanes of this occupation so order them,
that by the time that they were come to be sixe or
seven yeares of age, they were able to get their owne
bread. Idlenesse was then banished our coast, so that
it was a rare thing to heare of a thiefe in those dayes.
Therefore it was not without cause that Clothiers were
then both honoured and loved."</p>

<p>Doubtless so soon as the merchant reached Launceston
he placed all the wool he purchased on carts, to
convey it to town through Exeter. Deloney tells an
amusing story of how King Henry was riding forth
west with one of his sons and some of his nobility,
when "he met with a great number of waines loaden
with cloth coming to London, and seeing them still
drive one after another so many together, demanded
whose they were. The wainemen answered in this
sort: Coles of Reading, quoth they. Then, by and by,
the King asked another, saying: Whose cloth is all
this? Old Coles, quoth he. And againe anon after
he asked the same questions to others, and still they
answered, Old Coles. And it is to be remembered that
the King met them in such a place so narrow and
streight, that hee with the rest of his traine were faine
to stand as close to the hedge, whilest the carts passed
by, the which at that time being in number above two
hundred, was neere hand an hour ere the King could
get room to be gone; so that by his long stay, he
began to be displeased, although the admiration of that
sight did much qualify his furie; but breaking out in
discontent, by reason of his stay, he said, I thought
Old Cole had got a commission for all the carts in the
country to carry his cloth. And how if he have (quoth
one of the wainemen) doth that grieve you, good Sir?
Yes, good Sir, said our King. What say you to that?
The fellow, seeing the King (in asking the question)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to bend his browes, though he knew not what he was,
yet being abasht, he answered thus: Why, Sir, if you be
angry, nobody can hinder you; for possibly, Sir, you
have anger at commandment. The King, seeing him
in uttering of his words to quiver and quake, laughed
heartily at him ... and by the time he came within a
mile of Staines, he met another company of waines,
in like sort laden with cloth, whereby the King was
driven into a further admiration; and demanding
whose they were, answere was made in this sort: They
bee goodman Sutton's of Salisbury, good Sir. And by
that time a score of them were past; he asked againe,
saying, Whose are these? Sutton's of Salisbury, quoth
they, and so still, so often as the King asked that question,
they answered, Sutton's of Salisbury. God send
me such more Suttons, said the King. And thus the
further he travelled westward, more waines and more
he met continually: upon which occasion he said to his
nobles, that it would never grieve a King to die for
the defence of a fertile country and faithful subjects.
I alwayes thought (quoth he) that England's valor was
more than her wealth, yet now I see her wealth sufficient
to maintaine her valour, which I will seek to cherish
in all I may, and with my sword keepe myselfe in possession
of that I have."</p>

<p>Judging by what Deloney says, these clothiers were
a merry set, and the journey to town was one long
picnic. They were&mdash;or some were&mdash;of good family.
Grey, the clothier of Gloucester, was of the noble race
of Grey de Ruthyn, and FitzAllen, of Worcester,
came of the Fitzallens, "that famous family whose
patrimony lay about the town of Oswestrie, which
towne his predecessors had inclosed with stately walls
of stone."</p>

<p>The most famous wool merchant in the West was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Tom Dove, of Exeter, concerning whom this song
was sung:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Welcome to town, Tom Dove, Tom Dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The merriest man alive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy company still we love, we love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God grant thee well to thrive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never will we depart from thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For better, for worse, my joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou shalt still have our good will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God's blessing on my sweet boy!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In London Thomasine comported herself well, was
cheerful and obliging. How the mercer's wife relished
her introduction into the house we are not informed.
But this good lady shortly after sickened and died, and
the widower offered Thomasine his hand and his heart,
which she accepted.</p>

<p>After three years Richard Bunsby, the mercer, died
and left all he had to Thomasine, so that she, who had
gone up to town as a serving girl, was now a rich
widow, and withal young and pretty and attractive.
She soon drew suitors about her, and her choice fell
on "that worshipful merchant adventurer, Master John
Gall, of S. Lawrence, Milk Street." He as well was
wealthy and uxorious, and he allowed his wife to
make donations for the relief of the poor of her native
village, for which she ever retained a lingering attachment.</p>

<p>After the lapse of five years Thomasine was again
a widow, and her second husband had followed the
example of the first in leaving to her all his possessions.</p>

<p>She had not to wait long before fresh suitors buzzed
about her like flies around a treacle barrel, and now, in
the year 1497, she gave her hand to Sir John Percival,
who in the following year became Lord Mayor of
London. In memory of this event, she is traditionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
held to have constructed a good road&mdash;as good
roads went in those days&mdash;from Week S. Mary down
to the coast, probably that over Week ford and
through Poundstock, to either Wansum or Melhuc
Mouth.</p>

<p>She long survived her third husband, and is supposed
to have returned to end her days as the Lady Bountiful
in her native village. By her will, made in 1510, she
left goodly sums of money to Week S. Mary.</p>

<p>But both she and Sir John Percival had been already
benefactors in London. Sir John had founded a
chantry in S. Mary Woolnoth, and in 1539 is found an
entry in the churchwardens' accounts of that parish
recording that Dame Thomasine Percival had left
money for the maintenance of the "beme light" in the
church, i.e. the lamp before the rood. She had also
left money to supply candles to burn about the sepulchre
in the church on Easter Day, and he had bequeathed
moneys for the repair of the ornaments of the
church, for bell-ringing, for singers "for keeping the
anthem," at his and her obits, and last but not least,
"for a potation to the neighbours at the said obit."</p>

<p>Carew says: "And to show that virtue as well bare a
part in the desert, as fortune in the means of her preferment,
she employed the whole residue of her life and
last widowhood to works no less bountiful than charitable,
namely, repairing of highways, building of
bridges, endowing of maidens, relieving of prisoners,
feeding and apparelling the poor, etc. Among the
rest, at this S. Mary Wike she founded a chantry and
free-school, together with fair lodgings for the schoolmasters,
scholars, and officers, and added £20 of yearly
revenue for supporting the incident charges: wherein,
as the bent of her desire was holy, so God blessed the
same with all wished success; for divers of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
gentlemen's sons of Devon and Cornwall were there
virtuously trained up, in both kinds of divine and
human learning, under one Cholwel, an honest and
religious teacher, which caused the neighbours so much
the rather and the more to rue, that a petty smack only
of Popery opened the gap to the oppression of the
whole, by the statute made in Edward VI's reign,
touching the suppression of chantries."</p>

<p>This disaster befell it in 1550, when all colleges,
chantries, free chapels, fraternities, and guilds throughout
the kingdom, with their lands and endowments,
were alienated to the King&mdash;not because there was
a "petty smack of Popery" in them, but because of
the rapacity of the courtiers who desired to gather the
lands and benefactions into their own soiled hands.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Tregellas says: "There are still to be
seen in the remote and quiet little village of Week
S. Mary, some five or six miles south of Bude, in the
northern corner of Cornwall, the substantial remains
of the good Thomasine's college and chantry, which
she founded for the instruction of the youth of her
native place.</p>

<p>"The buildings lie about a hundred yards east of
the church (from the summit of whose grotesquely
ornamented tower six-and-twenty parish churches may
be discerned), and built into the modern wall of a
cottage which stands inside the battlemented enclosure
is a large carved granite stone (evidently one of two
which once formed the tympanum of a doorway), on
which the letter T stands out in bold relief. Probably
it is the initial of the Christian name of our Thomasine;
at any rate, it is pleasant to think it may be such."</p>

<p>The church and its stately tower were probably built
by Thomasine, or, at all events, she would have largely
contributed towards the building. That church is now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
internally, a ghastly sight. At its "restoration" it
was gutted, and is as bare as a railway station&mdash;a
shell, and nothing more. But that it was not so in
Dame Thomasine's time we may be well assured. A
gorgeous screen extended across its nave and aisles,
richly sculptured and coloured and gilt, the windows
were filled with stained glass, and the bench ends
were of carved oak. All this has been swept away.</p>

<p>In the Stratton churchwardens' accounts for 1513
we find that on the day upon which "My Lady
Parcyvale's Meneday" came round&mdash;i.e. the day on
which her death was called to mind&mdash;prayer was to be
made for the repose of her soul, and two shillings and
two pence paid to two priests, and for bread and ale.</p>

<h2>THE MURDER OF NEVILL NORWAY</h2>


<p>Mr. Nevill Norway was a timber
and general merchant, residing at Wadebridge.
He was the second son of
William Norway, of Court Place, Egloshayle,
who died in 1819, and Nevill was baptized at
Egloshayle Church on November 5th, 1801.</p>

<p>In the course of his business he travelled about the
country and especially attended markets, and he went
to one at Bodmin on the 8th of February, 1840, on horseback.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the afternoon he was transacting
some little affair in the market-place, and had his
purse in his hand, opened it and turned out some gold
and silver, and from the sum picked out what he
wanted and paid the man with whom he was doing
business. Standing close by and watching him was a
young man named William Lightfoot, who lived at
Burlorn, in Egloshayle, and whom he knew well
enough by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Norway did not leave Bodmin till shortly before
ten o'clock, and he had got about nine miles to ride
before he would reach his house. The road was lonely
and led past the Dunmeer Woods and that of Pencarrow.</p>

<p>He was riding a grey horse, and he had a companion,
who proceeded with him along the road for
three miles and then took his leave and branched off
in another direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>A farmer returning from market somewhat later to
Wadebridge saw a grey horse in the road, saddled and
bridled, but without a rider. He tried at first to overtake
it, but the horse struck into a gallop and he gave
up the chase; his curiosity was, however, excited, and
upon meeting some men on the road, and making inquiry,
they told him that they thought that the grey
horse that had just gone by them belonged to Mr.
Norway. This induced him to call at the house of that
gentleman, and he found the grey steed standing at the
stable gate. The servants were called out, and spots
of blood were found upon the saddle. A surgeon was
immediately summoned, and two of the domestics
sallied forth on the Bodmin road, in quest of their
master. The search was not successful that night, but
later, one of the searchers perceiving something white in
the little stream of water that runs beside the highway
and enters the river Allen at Pendavey Bridge, they
examined it, and found the body of their unfortunate
master, lying on his back in the stream, with his feet
towards the road, and what they had seen glimmering
in the uncertain light was his shirt frill. He was quite
dead.</p>

<p>The body was at once placed on the horse and conveyed
home, where the surgeon, named Tickell, proceeded
to examine it. He found that the deceased had received
injuries about the face and head, produced by heavy
and repeated blows from some blunt instrument, which
had undoubtedly been the cause of death. A wound
was discovered under the chin, into which it appeared
as if some powder had been carried; and the bones of
the nose, the forehead, the left side of the head and the
back of the skull were frightfully fractured.</p>

<p>An immediate examination of the spot ensued when
the body had been found, and on the left-hand side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the road was seen a pool of blood, from which to the
rivulet opposite was a track produced by the drawing
of a heavy body across the way, and footsteps were observed
as of more than one person in the mud, and it
was further noticed that the boots of those there impressed
must have been heavy. There had apparently
been a desperate scuffle before Mr. Norway had been
killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_164.png" id="i_164.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_164.png" alt="NEVILL NORWAY" title="NEVILL NORWAY" />
   <p class="caption2">NEVILL NORWAY<br />
<i>From a painting in the possession of Miss A. T. Norway</i></p>
</div>

<p>There was further evidence. Two sets of footmarks
could be traced of men pacing up and down behind a
hedge in an orchard attached to an uninhabited house
hard by; apparently men on the watch for their intended
victim.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the pool of blood was found
the hammer of a pistol that had been but recently
broken off.</p>

<p>Upon the pockets of the deceased being examined, it
became obvious that robbery had been the object of
the attack made upon him, for his purse and a tablet
and bunch of keys had been carried off.</p>

<p>Every exertion was made to discover the perpetrators
of the crime, and large rewards were offered for evidence
that should tend to point them out. Jackson, a
constable from London, was sent for, and mainly by
his exertions the murderers were tracked down. A
man named Harris, a shoemaker, deposed that he had
seen the two brothers, James and William Lightfoot, of
Burlorn, in Egloshayle, loitering about the deserted
cottage late at night after the Bodmin fair; and a man
named Ayres, who lived next door to James Lightfoot,
stated that he had heard his neighbour enter his cottage
at a very late hour on the night in question, and say
something to his wife and child, upon which they
began to weep. What he had said he could not hear,
though the partition between the cottages was thin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>This led to an examination of the house of James
Lightfoot on February 14th, when a pistol was found,
without a lock, concealed in a hole in a beam that ran
across the ceiling. As the manner of Lightfoot was
suspicious, he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>On the 17th his brother William was arrested in
consequence of a remark to a man named Vercoe that
he was in it as well as James. He was examined before
a magistrate, and made the following confession:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I went to Bodmin last Saturday week, the 8th
instant, and on returning I met my brother James just
at the head of Dunmeer Hill. It was just come dim-like.
My brother had been to Burlorn, Egloshayle, to
buy potatoes. Something had been said about meeting;
but I was not certain about that. My brother
was not in Bodmin on that day. Mr. Vercoe overtook
us between Mount Charles Turnpike Gate at the top of
Dunmeer Hill and a place called Lane End. We came
on the turnpike road all the way till we came to the
house near the spot where the murder was committed.
We did not go into the house, but hid ourselves in a
field. My brother knocked Mr. Norway down; he
snapped a pistol at him twice, and it did not go off.
Then he knocked him down with the pistol. He was
struck whilst on horseback. It was on the turnpike
road between Pencarrow Mill and the directing-post
towards Wadebridge. I cannot say at what time of
the night it was. We left the body in the water on the
left side of the road coming to Wadebridge. We took
money in a purse, but I do not know how much it was.
It was a brownish purse. There were some papers,
which my brother took and pitched away in a field on
the left-hand side of the road, into some browse or furze.
The purse was hid by me in my garden, and afterwards
I threw it over Pendavey Bridge. My brother drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the body across the road to the water. We did not
know whom we stopped till when my brother snapped
the pistol at him. Mr. Norway said, 'I know what you
are about. I see you.' We went home across the
fields. We were not disturbed by any one. The pistol
belonged to my brother. I don't know whether it was
broken; I never saw it afterwards; and I do not know
what became of it. I don't know whether it was soiled
with blood. I did not see any blood on my brother's
clothes. We returned together, crossing the river at
Pendavey Bridge and the Treraren fields to Burlorn
village. My brother then went to his house and I to
mine. I think it was handy about eleven o'clock. I
saw my brother again on the Sunday morning. He
came to my house. There was nobody there but my
own family. He said, 'Dear me, Mr. Norway is killed.'
I did not make any reply."</p>

<p>The prisoner upon this was remanded to Bodmin
gaol, where his brother was already confined, and on
the way he pointed out the furze bush in which the
tablet and the keys of the deceased were to be found.
James Lightfoot, in the meantime, had also made a
confession, in which he threw the guilt of the murder
upon his brother William.</p>

<p>This latter, when in prison, admitted that his confession
had not been altogether true. He and his brother
had met by appointment, with full purpose to rob the
Rev. W. Molesworth, of S. Breock, returning from
Bodmin market, and when James had snapped his
pistol twice at Mr. Norway, he, William, had struck
him with a stick on the back of his head and felled
him from his horse, whereupon James had battered his
head and face with the pistol.</p>

<p>The two wretched men were tried at Bodmin on
March 30th, 1840, before Mr. Justice Coltman, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
jury returned a verdict of "Guilty"; they were accordingly
both sentenced to death, and received the
sentence with great stolidity.</p>

<p>Up to this time the brothers had been allowed no
opportunity for communication, and the discrepancy in
their stories distinctly enough showed that the object
of each was to screen himself and to secure the conviction
of the other.</p>

<p>After the passing of the sentence on them, they were
conveyed to the same cell, and were now, for the first
time, allowed to approach each other. They had
scarcely met before, in the most hardened manner, they
broke out into mutual recrimination, using the most
horrible and abusive language of each other, and,
not content with this, they flew at each other's throat,
so that the gaolers were obliged to interfere and separate
them and confine them in separate apartments.</p>

<p>On April 7th their families were admitted to bid them
farewell, and the scene was most distressing. On
Monday morning, April 13th, they were both executed,
and it was said that upwards of ten thousand persons
had assembled to witness their end.</p>

<p>As Mr. Norway's family was left in most straitened
circumstances, a collection was made for them in Cornwall,
and the sum of £3500 was raised on their behalf.</p>

<p>William Lightfoot was aged thirty-six and James
thirty-three when hanged at Bodmin.</p>

<p>There is a monument to the memory of Mr. Norway
in Egloshayle Church.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cornwall Gazette</i>, 17th April, 1840, the
portraits of the murderers were given. Mention is
made of the tragedy in C. Carlyon's <i>Early Years</i>, 1843.
He gives the following story. At the time of the
murder, Edmund Norway, the brother of Nevill, was in
command of a merchant vessel, the <i>Orient</i>, on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
voyage from Manilla to Cadiz. He wrote on the same
day as the murder:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">

"Ship <i>Orient</i>, from Manilla to Cadiz,<br />
<br />
"<i>Feb.</i> 8th, 1840.<br />
</p>

<p>"About 7.30 p.m. the island of S. Helena, N.N.W.,
distant about seven miles, shortened sail and rounded
to, with the ship's head to the eastward; at eight, set
the watch and went below&mdash;wrote a letter to my brother,
Nevell Norway. About twenty minutes or a quarter
before ten o'clock went to bed&mdash;fell asleep, and dreamt
I saw two men attack my brother and murder him.
One caught the horse by the bridle and snapped a
pistol twice, but I heard no report; he then struck him
a blow, and he fell off the horse. They struck him
several blows, and dragged him by the shoulders
across the road and left him. In my dream there was
a house on the left-hand side of the road. At five o'clock
I was called, and went on deck to take charge of the
ship. I told the second officer, Mr. Henry Wren, that
I had had a dreadful dream, and dreamt that my
brother Nevell was murdered by two men on the road
from S. Columb to Wadebridge; but I was sure it
could not be there, as the house there would have been
on the right-hand side of the road, but it must have
been somewhere else. He replied, 'Don't think anything
about it; you West-country people are superstitious;
you will make yourself miserable the remainder
of the passage. He then left the general
orders and went below. It was one continued dream
from the time I fell asleep until I was called, at five
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Edmund Norway</span>,<br />
"Chief Officer, Ship <i>Orient</i>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are some difficulties about this account. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
dated, as may be seen, February 8th, but it must have
been written on February 9th, after Mr. Norway had
had the dream, and the date must refer to the letter
written to his brother and to the dream, and not to the
time when the account was penned.</p>

<p>From the Cape of Good Hope to S. Helena the
course would be about N.N.W., and with a fair wind
the ship would cover about eighty or ninety miles in
eight hours. So that at noon of the day February
8th she would be about one hundred miles S.S.E. of
S. Helena, i.e. in about 5° W. longitude, as nearly
as possible. The ship's clock would then be set, and
they would keep that time for letter-writing purposes,
meals, ship routine, etc.</p>

<table class="middle">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Ship, &emsp;long.</td>
            <td>5°&emsp;0' 0" W.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bodmin &ensp;"</td>
            <td>4° 40' 0" W.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Difference</td>
            <td>&emsp;&ensp;20' 0"</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The difference would be twenty minutes of longitude,
and the difference in time between the two places one
degree apart is four minutes. Reduce this to seconds:&mdash;</p>

<table class="middle">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">4 × 60 × 20</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
            <td>= 80 sec., i.e. 1 min. 20 sec.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">60</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Therefore, if the murder was committed, say, at
10h. 30m. p.m. Bodmin time, the time on the ship's
clock would be 10h. 28m. 40s. p.m. An inconsiderable
difference.</p>

<p>The log-book of Edmund Norway is said to be still in
existence.</p>

<p>One very remarkable point deserves notice. In his
dream Mr. Edmund Norway saw the house on the right
hand of the road, and as he remembered, on waking, that
the cottage was on the left hand, he consoled himself
with the thought that if the dream was incorrect in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
point it might be in the whole. But he was unaware
that during his absence from England the road from
Bodmin to Wadebridge had been altered, and that it
had been carried so that the position of the house was
precisely as he saw it in his dream, and the reverse of
what he had remembered it to be.</p>

<p>Another point to be mentioned is that one of the
murderers wore on that occasion a coat which Mr.
Norway had given him a few weeks before, out of
charity.</p>

<p>Both brothers protested that they had not purposed
the murder of Mr. Norway but of the Rev. Mr. Molesworth,
parson of S. Breock, who they supposed was
returning with tithe in his pocket. This, however, did
not agree with the evidence that William Lightfoot had
watched him counting his money at Bodmin, and then
had made off.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the discovery of the murder, Sir
William Molesworth sent his bloodhounds to track the
murderers, but because they ran in a direction opposed
to that which the constables supposed was the right
one they were recalled. The hounds were right, the
constables wrong.</p>

<h2>SIR WILLIAM LOWER, KNT.</h2>


<p>Sir William Lower was the only son
of John Lower, and was born at Tremere, in
S. Tudy, about the year 1600.</p>

<p>The Lowers were a very ancient family in
Cornwall, seated in S. Winnow parish, and at Clifton,
in Landulph, at which latter place lived Sir Nicholas
Lower, the brother of John, whilst the eldest brother, Sir
William, settled at Treventy, in Carmarthen, having
married the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas
Pescott, of that place. John had two other brothers
knights, Sir Francis and Sir Thomas.</p>

<p>William was not educated at Oxford, but, as Wood
says, "spent some time in Oxon, in the condition of
<i>hospes</i>, for the sake of the public library and scholastical
company." He exhibited a "gay fancy," and a mighty
aversion from the dry and crabbed studies of logic and
philosophy.</p>

<p>Leaving Oxford, he spent some time in France, where
he became a master of the French tongue, and acquired
a great admiration for the dramatic compositions of
Corneille, Quirault, and Ceriziers, and in after years
amused himself with translating some of their plays.</p>

<p>When the troubles broke out in England he took
the King's side, and in 1640 was a lieutenant in Sir
Jacob Ashley's regiment in Northumberland's army
against the Scotch Covenanters, and was then appointed
captain, but lost his company, that proved
mutinous and deserted. "It was a marvellous thing,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
says a writer of the time, "to observe the averseness
of the common soldiers to this war. Though commanders
and gentlemen of great quality, in pure
obedience to the King, seemed not at all to dispute
the cause or consequence of this war, the common
soldiers would not be satisfied, questioning, in a
mutinous manner, whether their captains were papists
or not, and in many places were not appeased till
they saw them receive the sacrament; laying violent
hands on divers of their commanders, and killing
some, uttering in bold speeches their distaste of
the cause, to the astonishment of many, that common
people should be sensible of public interest and religion,
when lords and gentlemen seemed not to be."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_174.png" id="i_174.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_174.png" alt="Sir William Lower" title="Sir William Lower" />
   <p class="caption2">S<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Lower&mdash;<br />
Pub May 21 1800 by W Richardson N<sup>o</sup> 31 Strond</p>
</div>

<p>In June, 1644, being a lieutenant-colonel in Thomas
Blague's regiment and lieutenant-governor of Wallingford,
Lower received orders from the King to raise £50
a week from the town of Reading. Lower at once laid
hands on the mayor and carried him to Wallingford as
a hostage; he then plied the corporation with demands
for the money, without which their head would not be
restored to them. The corporation, however, did not
value their mayor so highly that they were disposed to
pay £50 per week for the privilege of having him restored
to them. Lower was taken prisoner by the
garrison of Abingdon on 19th January, 1645-6, and
Charles rewarded him for his zeal by conferring on him
knighthood.</p>

<p>He remained in England for nearly ten more years
and saw the ruin of the Royal cause, which he did
care for, and of the Church, for which he cared not
a rush. In 1655 he quitted England and went to
Cologne, which was full of refugees, and there he was
cheered with the tidings that Oliver Cromwell was
failing in health and had not long to live. Leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Cologne, after a brief residence there, he "took
sanctuary in Holland, where in peace and privacy he
enjoyed the society of the Muses," says Langhorn.</p>

<p>His <i>The Ph&#339;nix in Her Flames</i>, a tragedy in four
acts, had been published in 1639. <i>The Innocent Lady,
or the Illustrious Innocence</i>, translated from the French
of R. de Ceriziers, was published in 1654. Now in
Holland he worked hard at other translations, and he
was the more able to do this at ease, as the Princess
Royal Mary of Orange seems to have taken him
into her retinue at the Hague. If the Court was
anything like what it was when James Howell was
there, it must have been vastly dull for the lively
and dissolute Sir William Lower. But his stay
was enlivened by the arrival of Charles and the intrigues
there carried on with the well-affected in England.</p>

<p>At the Hague he issued a thin royal folio, with
many plates, entitled "A relation in form of Journal
of the voiage and residence which the most excellent and
most mighty Prince, Charles the II, King of Great
Britain, etc., hath made in Holland, from the 25th of May
to the 2nd of June, 1660, rendered into English from the
original French. By Sir W. Lower, Knt. Printed
by Adrian Ulack." This was published in Dutch,
French, and English, and at the end of the volume
Sir W. Lower inserted his poems, and an apology for
the "tardive appearance (of the book) due to those
men who grave the plates."</p>

<p>Such "poems" as he has given as his own show
conclusively enough that he was not a poet, but a mere
hammerer together of rhymes.</p>

<p>In June, 1660, calculating on his services rendered
to Charles I and to the sumptuous book on the residence
in Holland of Charles II that he had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
out, Lower appealed to Secretary Nicholas from The
Hague to obtain for him some place in the King's
service. But the death of his cousin Thomas, only
son of Sir William Lower, of Treventy, who died on
5th February, 1661, by which he became sole heir,
executor, and chief representative of the family, recalled
him to England. He did not, however, enjoy ease
long, for he died in the ensuing year, 1662, leaving an
only child, Elizabeth, who probably died early, for
nothing further is known of her than that she was in
existence when her father died. Who the wife of Sir
William Lower was is not known.</p>

<p>His cousin, Dr. Richard Lower, of S. Paul's,
Covent Garden, who gave Wood information relative
to his kinsman, described him as "an ill poet and a
worse man."</p>

<p>His long residence abroad, his dissociation from
Cornwall for all his life save his early boyhood, his
separation from his kinsmen, had broken all the ties
that linked him to his family and county; and when
he inherited the estates and was in a position to assist
his kinsmen who had been greatly reduced by the
civil wars, "he did not, but followed the vices of
poets."</p>

<h2>THE PIRATES AT PENZANCE</h2>


<p>An event occurred at Penzance in the year 1760
that deserves to be remembered. Great
Britain had been engaged in the Seven
Years War; and notwithstanding the
successes of 1759, when Rodney bombarded Havre,
Boscawen had routed and dispersed the Toulon fleet off
Lagos, and Hawke had defeated the fleet of De Conflans
near Quiberon, there was still a certain amount of
alarm in the country, a dread of predatory incursions,
and if this fear existed inland, it was most acute upon
the coast.</p>

<p>On the night of the 29-30th September Penzance
was alarmed by the firing of guns, and soon after by
the intelligence that a large ship of a strange appearance
had run ashore near Newlyn. Half Penzance
poured out in that direction in the grey of early morning.
But on reaching the strand they were panic-stricken
to see on the ship, and drawn up on the beach,
a number of ferocious-looking individuals with baggy
trousers, and red fezes on their heads, and each armed
with a scimitar, and with brass-mounted pistols stuck in
their girdles. Thereupon the half of Penzance that had
turned out now turned tail and made the best of their
way back to the town, crying out that the Turks had
landed and were intent on massacring the inhabitants of
Penzance, plundering their houses, and carrying away
their wives and children into captivity to become galley-slaves
or to fill the harems of these Moslem monsters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>A volunteer company was called out, the drum beat
to arms, and marched to the beach, where they found
172 men, who were surrounded, deprived of their
weapons, and marched to a spacious building called
"The Folly," that stood on the Western Green. As
there were some of the captives who could speak the
<i>lingua franca</i>, and there was here and there to be
found a magistrate or an officer who had a limited
knowledge of French, it was at last elicited from these
men that they were the crew of an Algerine corsair,
carrying twenty-four guns, from nine to six pounders.
The captain, believing himself to be in the Atlantic,
somewhere about the latitude of Cadiz, had cheerily in
the dark run his vessel into Mount's Bay, and was
vastly surprised when she struck, and still more so
when he found himself surrounded by Cornishmen and
not by Spaniards. He had lost eight men, drowned.</p>

<p>No sooner was this bruited about than a second
panic set in, and the good citizens of Penzance went
into hysterics of fear lest these Algerine pirates should
have brought with them an invasion of the plague.</p>

<p>A cordon of volunteers was accordingly drawn up
round "The Folly" to prevent all intercourse, intelligence
was conveyed to the Government, and orders
were issued for troops to march from Plymouth so as
to surround the whole district. However, the local
authorities recovered from their terror or apprehension
in time to send off information that there was no cause
for such a measure, and the orders were countermanded.</p>

<p>After some days, when no case of plague had revealed
itself among the captives, the people of the town and
neighbourhood were suffered to approach and contemplate
the strangers. Their Oriental dress, their long
beards and moustaches, the dark complexion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
glittering eyes of the piratical band, made them objects
of curiosity. But they still inspired so much fear that
few ventured to approach near to them.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, they were kindly treated, and finally,
as their vessel was a complete wreck, a man-of-war was
despatched to take all the men on board and convey
them back to Algiers.</p>

<h2>DAME KILLIGREW</h2>


<p>The Killigrew family is one of the most
ancient in Cornwall. It takes its name from
Killigrew in the parish of S. Erme. Here
stands the old nest of the family beside the
high road from Truro that falls into that from Redruth
to Bodmin at Casland. It is now represented by a
couple of insignificant cottages, without old trees
surrounding it, and the only hint that it was once the
seat of a distinguished family is found in the remains
of the deerpark.</p>

<p>The genuine pedigree of the family goes back to
Ralph Killigrew of Killigrew, in the reign of Henry
III. In that of Richard II, Simon Killigrew married
Jane, daughter and heiress of Robert of Arwenack, near
Penryn, and he quitted the ancestral mansion to move
to his wife's house that was planted in a less bleak
situation and was on the estuary of the Fal.</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir John Killigrew
of Arwenack, was Captain in Command of Pendennis
Castle. He married Mary, daughter of Philip Wolverston
and widow of Henry Knyvett of an Eastern
counties family, but her son by Henry Knyvett settled
in Cornwall, at Rosemorryn in S. Budoc. Sir John
pulled down the greater portion of the ancient house
and built himself another, very stately in the style of
the times&mdash;but, alas! this also has disappeared, for
when Sir William Waller approached Pendennis, to
besiege it on behalf of the Parliament, the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of the Castle set fire to Arwenack lest it should
give harbour to the enemy.</p>

<p>Sir John had a son, also called John, who married
Dorothy, daughter of the impecunious Sir Thomas
Monck, Knt., of Potheridge, which Sir Thomas died
in the debtors' gaol at S. Thomas', by Exeter. John
and Dorothy had a son, Sir John Killigrew, aged
twenty-two on his father's death in 1605.</p>

<p>Now it fell out that Sir Walter Raleigh on his homeward
voyage from Guiana put into Falmouth harbour,
and found there, where the town now stands, only a
fisherman's cottage. Killigrew, however, hospitably
entertained Sir Walter, who expressed his surprise that
so fine a harbour should have no accommodation for
sailors sheltering there, and when he went to town
memorialized King James on the subject. He had
fired the imagination of his host, Sir John, and he
also petitioned the King to grant him a royal licence
to build four houses, where now stands Falmouth, for
the convenience of sailors. This roused the wrath of
the people of Penryn further up the river, who saw
that four houses would bring in their wake many more,
and would draw away the trade, and cut off the prosperity
of Penryn. Accordingly they used every possible
endeavour to obstruct the project. Sir John made
several journeys to London, but it was only by spending
a great deal of money in fees and bribery of
officials that he was able to obtain the licence; and by
so doing he incurred the implacable resentment of the
inhabitants of Penryn.</p>

<p>We will now let Martin Killigrew continue the story.
He wrote a history of the family in 1737 or 1738. We
will somewhat simplify the reading by giving "the"
for "y<sup>e</sup>."</p>

<p>"The last Sir John Killigrew was hardly got over this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
difficulty, when he fell under a much greater affliction, the
prostitution of his wife, who caused herself to be called,
or unaccountably was known by the name of Lady Jane."
He has already stated, "Sir John Killigrew, a sober,
good man, to his utter undoing, married the daughter
of an ancient and honourable family, new in the peerage,
in respect to whom I forbear the name; making
herself infamous, and first debauched by the Governor
of Pendennis Castle." This lady was Jane, daughter of
Sir George Fermon, of Northampton. Sir William,
his brother, was created Baron Leominster in 1622,
whose son was given the earldom of Pomfret in 1721.</p>

</div>

<p>"Arrived to that shameful degree, Sir John, in point
of honour and for quietness of mind, found himself
under a necessity to prosecute a divorce from her in the
Archbishop's Court, which lasted so many years and
[was] so very expensive, as quite ruined his estate, to
the degree of his being often put to very hard shifts to
get home from London upon the frequent recesses in the
process, but at length obtained the divorce in all its
formal extent. This woman in such long contest was
in no degree protected by her family, but supported
and cherished by the town of Penryn, from their
jealousy and hatred of Arwenack, as specially appears
to this day, by plate by her given to the Mayor
and Corporation of Penryn, when she came into her
jointure, as an acknowledgment for such protection.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Sir John did not long outlive such his divorce, dying
in 1632."</p>

<p>Hals says: "Jane Killigrew, widow of Sir John
Killigrew, Knt., in the Spanish wars in the latter end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, went on board two
Dutch ships of the Hans Towns (always free traders in
times of war) driven into Falmouth harbour by cross
winds, laden with merchandise, on account (as was
said) of Spaniards, and with a numerous party of
ruffians, murdered the two Spanish merchants or
factors on board these ships, and took from them two
barrels or hogsheads of Spanish pieces of eight, and
converted them to her own use."</p>

<p>"Now, though Fleta (lib. i. c. iii., temp. Edward
II) tells us that it is no murder except it be proved that
the party slain was English, and no stranger, yet
afterwards by the statute 4 Edward III, the killing
any foreigner under the King's protection, out of evil
design or malice, is murder; upon which statute these
offenders were tried and found guilty at Launceston of
wilful murder, both by the grand and petty juries, and
had sentence of death passed accordingly upon them,
and were all executed, except the said Lady Killigrew,
the principal agent and contriver of the barbarous fact,
who, by the interest and favour of Sir John Arundell,
of Tolverne, Knt., and his son-in-law, Sir Nicholas
Hals, of Pengersick, Knt., obtained of Queen Elizabeth
a pardon or reprieve for the said lady, which was
seasonably put into the Sheriff of Cornwall's hands.</p>

<p>"At the news whereof the other condemned wretches
aforesaid at the gallows lamented nothing more than that
they had not the company of that old Jezebel Killigrew
at that place as in justice they ought to be (to use their
own words), and begged Almighty God that some remarkable
judgment might befall her and her posterity,
nay, and all those that were instrumental in procuring
her freedom, and observed hereupon it was, that her
grandson Sir William Killigrew spent the whole
paternal estate of his ancestors, as did Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Arundell, Knt., son of Sir John Arundell, aforesaid,
and John Hals, Esq., son of Sir Nicolas Hals, Knt., in
their own times, but alas, several and public revolutions
of this kind; and all other in worldly affairs are
carried on by the judgment and providence of God,
not the determination of men, especially such barbarous
ruffians as these criminals, though these things happened
according to the malefactors' direful imprecations
in some sense."</p>

<p>Hals in the above account makes several blunders.
The affair to which he alludes took place in January,
1583, and the Dame Killigrew who was involved in it
was Mary, wife of Sir John, the grandfather of the
Sir John who divorced his wife Jane. Another mistake
is that the ship was not one of the Hanseatic town merchant
vessels, but was Spanish. Moreover, Hals is
wrong in saying that the two Spanish merchants were
murdered. On the contrary, Lady Killigrew's ruffians
threw overboard and drowned the whole ship's crew,
with the exception of the two merchants, who were on
shore and so escaped.</p>

<p>The facts are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Mary</i> of S. Sebastian, a Spanish ship of 144
tons burden, owned by two merchants, John de Chavis
and Philip de Oryo, the latter being as well the captain,
arrived in Falmouth harbour on January 1st, 1582-3,
and cast anchor within the bar, just under Sir John
Killigrew's house of Arwenack. Here for lack of
wind it remained, and the owners went on shore and
took up their quarters in an inn at Penryn, awaiting a
favourable breeze. At this time there was no open
breach of peace between England and Spain. It was
not till 1585 that Elizabeth sent over an army into the
Netherlands to oppose the forces of Philip II, and despatched
a fleet under Sir Francis Drake into the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Indies to molest the Spanish galleons and colonies
there.</p>

<p>Lady Killigrew seems to have formed a scheme for
robbing the merchant vessel and massacring the crew
and the owners, and several efforts were made to induce
the two merchants to quit their inn at Penryn and
return on board, so that the whole of those on the
vessel and the merchants might be got rid of, and not
a witness left. However, this failed; Chavis and Oryo
did not return to their ship.</p>

<p>About midnight on 7th January a boatload of men
boarded the Spanish vessel and overpowered the sailors,
raised the anchors, and set sail. The Spaniards were
all either butchered or thrown into the sea. The ship
was then taken to Ireland, where she was plundered
and the spoil divided. But before this was done, two
of Lady Killigrew's servants, named Kendal and Hawkins,
were sent back to Arwenack with sundry bolts
of Hollands and leather, as the share of Lady Killigrew,
her kinswoman, Mrs. Killigrew, and the maids and servants
in the house.</p>

<p>Lady Killigrew was highly incensed at being put off
with so little, but fume as she might she could do
nothing, for the ship was on its way to Ireland. What
she did accordingly was to keep all that was sent on
shore for herself, and distribute none of it among her
household.</p>

<p>The two merchants now stirred, and laid formal
complaint before the Commissioners for Piracy in
Cornwall. Among these was Sir John Killigrew, the
husband of the lady who had contrived or abetted
the act. A meeting was held at Penryn, and sufficient
evidence was produced to implicate Hawkins and
Kendal; but this they were able to rebut by the testimony
of Elizabeth Bowden, who kept a small tavern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
at Penryn, and who swore that up to the time that the
act of piracy was committed the two men Hawkins and
Kendal were drinking in her inn. The jury returned
an open verdict that the ship had certainly been stolen,
but by whom there was no evidence to show.</p>

<p>Chavis and De Oryo were not men disposed to let
the matter rest thus, and having procured a safe conduct
to London from the Commissioners, they proceeded
thither, and laid their complaint before the higher
authorities, with the result that the Earl of Bedford instructed
Sir Richard Grenville and Mr. Edmund
Tremayne to make a searching investigation into the
affair.</p>

<p>As might be anticipated, this inquiry was more
thorough-going and real than the other, and the truth
was at last elicited from witnesses very reluctant to
speak what they knew. The result arrived at was
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The whole plot had been contrived by Dame Killigrew,
who on the Sunday in question ordered Hawkins
and Kendal to board the Spaniard, along with a party
of sailors and fishermen got together for the purpose.
Moreover, she sent a messenger by boat to the Governor
of St. Mawes Castle, to inform him that the
Spanish merchants proposed to sail that night, and to
request him not to hinder them from so doing. The other
castle, that of Pendennis, commanding the entrance to
the haven, had Sir John Killigrew as Governor, and in
it all day were harboured the boarding-party destined
to carry off the merchantman.</p>

<p>Hawkins, who was the ringleader, had been sworn to
strict secrecy by Lady Killigrew, who desired to keep
the whole transaction from the knowledge of her husband.
The leather that fell to her share was placed in a
cask and buried in the garden at Arwenack. Hawkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and Kendal were hanged at Launceston, but Lady Killigrew
escaped as Hals relates. Sir John died next year;
when Lady Killigrew died is not known.</p>

<p>On the death of the later Sir John in 1633, Arwenack
passed to his nephew, as he left no issue, and that
nephew, Sir Peter Killigrew, married Frances,
daughter and co-heiress of Sir Roger Twysden. He
had two daughters, and a son George who came to an
untimely end.</p>

<p>He was killed in a drunken brawl in a tavern at
Penryn by Walter Vincent, barrister-at-law, "who,"
says Hals, "was tried for his life at Launceston for the
fact, and acquitted by the petty jury, through bribery
and indiscreet acts and practices, as was generally said;
yet this Mr. Vincent, through anguish and horror at
this accident (as it was said), within two years after
wasted of an extreme atrophy of his flesh and spirits,
that at length at the table whereby he was sitting, in
the Bishop of Exeter's palace, in the presence of divers
gentlemen, he instantly fell back against the wall and
died."</p>

<p>Frances, the eldest daughter of Sir Peter Killigrew,
married Richard Erisey, and had a daughter who
became the wife of John West, of Bury S. Edmunds,
and by him had a daughter Frances, who married the
Hon. Charles Berkeley, and through their descent the
estates, or such as remained of the old family of Killigrew,
passed to the Earl of Kimberley.</p>

<p>The history of the Killigrew family, by Martin
Killigrew, was published in part by Mr. R. N. Worth
in the <i>Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall</i>, Vol.
III (1868-70), and the story of the seizure of the Spanish
vessel by Dame Killigrew was investigated by Mr.
H. M. Whitley, in the <i>Journal</i>, Vol. VII (1881-3).</p>

<h2>TWO NATURALISTS IN CORNWALL</h2>


<p>The two men of science of whom a sketch is
about to be given here were neither of them
Cornishmen by birth and parentage, but,
inasmuch as a long stretch of the life of
each was spent in the delectable duchy, and as both
were well known in it and made it the principal
field of their labours, they deserve a place in this
collection. These two men are John Ralfs, the
botanist, and George Carter Bignell, the entomologist.</p>

<p>John Ralfs was born September 13, 1807, at Millbrook,
near Southampton. His father, Samuel Ralfs,
died when he was a year old, and to his mother was
entrusted his early training. From an early age he
manifested a passionate love of flowers, and as he
grew older an interest in chemistry. Probably on
this latter account he decided on the medical profession,
and whilst studying medicine he prosecuted
botanical research, so that on passing his final examination
the President of the Royal College of Surgeons
complimented him on his botanical knowledge, and
predicted that the world would one day hear a good
deal of this then "beardless boy."</p>

<p>He married a Miss Newman, and by her had a son,
but they were in every way an ill-suited pair, and after
a while they agreed to part, and she went to reside in
France, taking her son with her.</p>

<p>Fortunately for science, Ralfs' health would not
stand the arduous and anxious life of a village doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and he threw up his profession and wandered about
in the south of England, a friendless, reserved, and
taciturn man, devoting all his time and attention to
botany. He settled finally in Penzance, in the year
1837, and became a familiar personality in the west
of Cornwall, rambling over the moors, creeping into
bogs, often on hands and knees, searching for rare
plants; "a terror to timid ladies, who would scuttle
away like frightened rabbits at the sight of this dark,
strange man hanging over some deep pool, peering
with his short-sighted eyes into what was to him
a paradise, and perhaps calling out aloud, forgetful
that he and nature were not alone, 'I see him! I've
got him!' And often he would be seen resting on
a stile, weary with his wanderings, his hat and coat
almost as green as the grass on one of his favourite
bogs, the marks of his last fray fresh upon them, his
collar disappearing, apparently, in vain search of his
cravat; gazing absently into the distance, where he
saw, doubtless, beautiful and rare specimens of his
Algæ and Diatomaceæ."</p>

<p>Mr. Ralfs was never so happy as when alone; he
did not care for society, least of all that of women,
and grievous deafness made it difficult for him to
engage in conversation. Even with men of science
like himself he did not care to associate, except
through written correspondence. At Penzance he
was generally regarded as "a bit total," a little,
perhaps not a little, off his head; but no one could
have other than a kind word to say of him, for he
never injured any one. Occasionally his son came
from France to pay his father a visit; but such visits
were brief; their tastes were not the same, and their
outlook into life was different.</p>

<p>Mr. Ralfs wrote a good deal. He contributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
proceedings of many learned societies, but especially
the Edinburgh Botanical Society. He was the author
of the botanical chapter in the <i>Guide to Ilfracombe</i>,
and of the "Sketch of the Botany of West Penwith"
in Mr. J. S. Courtney's <i>Guide to Penzance</i>. Mr.
J. T. Blight also was assisted by him in his <i>Week
at the Land's End</i>. He helped as well in <i>English
Botany</i>, by Sir James E. Smith, the figures by James
Sowerby. He composed, moreover, a <i>Flora of West
Cornwall</i> that remains in MS. in the Penzance Public
Library.</p>

</div>

<p>Late in life he formed a tender attachment for a little
child, who had somehow hitched herself on to him
as a companion in his rambles. "The first overtures
were entirely on her own side, and it was some time
before this acquaintance ripened into friendship. She
was a delicate child, and her playfellow&mdash;for such he
became&mdash;prescribed Fresh Air and no Lessons; and so
off they would go for long country walks, much to the
benefit of her health, but to the detriment of her
clothes. Of the mustard poultice that sometimes
these excursions rendered necessary, and which could
not be endured unless he submitted to a similar
infliction; of the delightful dolls' tea parties; of the
fairy tales, translated solely for her amusement from
the French and German; of his selections from
Thackeray and Dickens, whose characters were thus
made living people to her; of the wonders that
awaited her on S. Valentine's Day, when, through
his skilful management, twenty or thirty valentines
were to arrive for her from different parts of the
country; of the choice variety of sweets he purchased
for her stocking at Christmas; of all this, I wish
I could discourse at greater length. It is sufficient
to say that this friendship, thus begun, lasted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
end of his life, and was the means of relieving to
a large extent that solitude which had before surrounded
him.</p>

<p>"On Midsummer Day, when the custom is to wear
wreaths of flowers, he would give free permission to
the children to pick all the flowers in his garden, on
condition that they would come to him flower-crowned
in the evening, when he would entertain them royally
with fruit and sweetmeats. On Corpus Christi Pleasure
Fair (a red-letter day for little Cornish children)
he would be seen with a small crowd of boys and girls
around him, whom he would treat to all the various
shows, waiting patiently, until their curiosity was satisfied,
outside."</p>

<p>One great delight of Mr. Ralfs was the naturalizing
of strange plants in the neighbourhood of Penzance,
amongst others the large-flowered butterwort, and very
much amused was he when some local paper with a
flourish of trumpets announced the discovery of the
Pinguicula by a botanical tourist, and a claim put
forward that it was indigenous to Cornwall.</p>

<p>John Ralfs died 14 July, 1890, and was buried at
Penzance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The second naturalist, Mr. George Carter Bignell, is
happily still alive and in full intellectual vigour, and
resides in Saltash. He is a native of Exeter, having
been born in that city in 1826. He was educated at
S. John's Hospital in his native town, but had to leave
it at the age of twelve, when he was placed in a booking-office
for receiving parcels and booking passengers
for the carriers who made the "Black Lion" their
head-quarters when in Exeter. These carriers came
from many small towns from twenty to fifty miles away.
The yard and stabling were connected with the "Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Lion" and the Commercial Inn, South Street, and
opposite was the office. Mr. Bignell says: "Often
have I seen these lumbering wagons with twenty
magnificent horses attached to them start from the
office, the driver riding a cob by the side. Very often
such a wagon would be conveying gold from the
ships in Falmouth to the Bank of England, and in that
case the wagon was attended by a guard carrying a
blunderbuss."</p>

<p>In this office Mr. Bignell remained till he was
sixteen, and in 1842 he joined the Royal Marines at
Stonehouse. He saw some foreign service, and was on
board the <i>Superb</i> during the civil war in Spain in 1847,
and was employed on the coasts of Spain and Portugal.
He was in the squadron which succeeded in capturing
a division of the rebel army of Count Das Anton, consisting
of about three thousand men. Boats' crews put
off from the ships of the squadron, and under a heavy
fire from the forts boarded and captured every vessel.
The prisoners were conveyed up the river Tagus to
Fort S. Julian, where, after being deprived of arms
and ammunition, they were safely lodged.</p>

<p>A guard, consisting of half the complement of
marines from each ship, was placed over them, the
whole body under the command of Major Stransham.</p>

<p>A few days after the capture it was discovered that
ammunition was being surreptitiously conveyed into
the fort by friends of the rebels, and investigation disclosed
that a plot had been hatched to blow up the fort.</p>

<p>Count Das Anton pretended to be wholly ignorant of
the conspiracy. The rebels were paraded, each man
searched, and every nook and cranny in the fort thoroughly
overhauled. A large quantity of gunpowder
was found, and this was promptly wheeled to the parapets
in barrows and thrown into the Tagus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The guard placed over this large body of prisoners
was small, and to overawe the prisoners all the marines
from the ships were landed every evening at sunset
and marched with fixed bayonets to the fort, with
orders to make as much noise and clatter as they
could; and then at night, when all was still, they stole
silently away from the fort and returned on board. So
well was the ruse practised every day that the prisoners
were under the impression that they were guarded by a
large body, and never suspected the truth. The time
at the fort was not very pleasant to the marines on
guard, as the place was filthy and literally swarmed
with fleas, and their white drill suits were so covered
with these detestable insects that the marines appeared
to be dressed in brown instead of white clothing.</p>

<p>This was Mr. Bignell's only taste of active service.
When the <i>Superb</i> was paid off he was employed in
several offices in the barracks, first as commanding
officer's clerk, and afterwards he was appointed to the
barracks at Millbay as barrack sergeant, and he held
this appointment for seven years. By the end of this
time he had served twenty-two years. Throughout all
this time he had been a keen and close observer of
nature. From his boyhood up natural history had
exercised a great attraction for him, and as he grew up,
and studied, the subject became more and more interesting.
During his last seven years of service he made
considerable progress, for as a barrack sergeant he had
little work to do, and so had plenty of time to devote to
his hobby.</p>

<p>After being discharged he became a member of the
Plymouth Institution, with the object of finding out the
names of some of the insects he had captured, and was
surprised to find that it had nothing like them in its
collection, nor could anybody tell him what they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bignell had barely retired from the service ere
he was appointed Registrar of Births and Deaths for
the Stonehouse district and also Poor Law Officer to
the Stonehouse Board of Guardians; but his residence
is in Saltash. All his spare time has for many years
been given up to scientific pursuits, the branch of
science to which he is most partial being entomology;
but since his residence in Saltash he has been a
profound student in marine flora. It is not only in
the study of the known and hitherto unregistered
insects that Mr. Bignell has acquired a world-wide
fame; he has specially taken up the subject, hitherto
almost untouched, of the parasites that live on insects.</p>

<p>To grasp what has been done by him an examination
must be made of the entomological journals for
the last forty years, for there he is generally in evidence.
In the proceedings of the Entomological Society of
London Mr. Bignell's name is quoted as being the
discoverer of fifty-one parasites, nineteen being new to
science and thirty-two new to Britain. In recognition
of this work, one of the new species has been named
after him <i>Mesoleius Bignellii</i>. The Royal Cornwall
Polytechnic Society have awarded him three of their
medals, a bronze one for "land and fresh water shells,"
a silver one for a "collection of British moths," and a
second silver medal for "butterflies and moths."</p>

<p>In the publications of the Ray Society on the
<i>Larvæ of British Butterflies and Moths</i>, at the end of
each volume we find a list of parasites preying on these
beautiful insects, "kindly prepared by Mr. G. C.
Bignell, <span class="smcap">f.e.s.</span>"</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary features of Mr.
Bignell's work is the infinite delicacy wherewith even
now at an advanced age he is able to draw and colour
his specimens. The miniature painter of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
girl's face a century ago did not take more pains to
delineate the object of his admiring study than does
Mr. Bignell to obtain a "counterfeit presentment" of
some disgusting caterpillar or parasitic insect.</p>

<p>The hunting for specimens would be an exhausting
toil were it not a labour of love. On one occasion Mr.
Bignell obtained one hundred and forty-one caterpillars
of a certain moth in Whitsand Bay, under Fort Tregantle.
They were feeding on henbane, and as he did
not know where else to get the right sort of food for them,
he had to go out two or three times a week for the food,
walking in all a hundred miles. But, alas for the
ingratitude of the caterpillars, not a single moth rewarded
all this devotion! Yet even this was outdone
by a hundred and thirty-five mile walk in the dark to
attempt to capture one sort of moth, which perhaps
deserves to be mentioned for its elusive ways. It is
called the <i>Dasycampa rubiginea</i>, and has to live up to
its name. Plym Bridge was supposed to be its haunt,
and its time of taking its walks or flutter abroad, night,
and that also in midwinter. So night after night in
November and December it was stalked, till one night,
between the 6th and 7th December, the moth was
spotted leisurely sipping honey from the flowers of the
ivy growing on one of the pillars of the old gateway
leading into Cann Wood between Plym Bridge and
Plympton, just as the clock at Morley House was striking
twelve.</p>

<p>A pathetic interest attaches to the large copper
butterfly. This splendid species was first discovered in
Wales by the celebrated botanist Hudson. It was subsequently
captured in considerable numbers about
Whittlesea Mere, in Huntingdonshire. Now, alas! it is
extinct, and a specimen such as one possessed by Mr.
Bignell is worth some pounds. The last secured was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in 1847. Greedy collectors and dealers from London,
after its discovery, were waiting for it, and offered
the country yokels five shillings for every caterpillar
secured. Now it is as extinct as the dodo and the
great auk.</p>

<p>There would seem to be no living creature that is not
a home and feeding ground for parasites; even the
butterflies are infested with them, and probably these
parasites also have others infinitely small that attack
them.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little fleas have lesser fleas&mdash;and so <i>ad infinitum</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most interesting discoveries made by Mr.
Bignell is that a creature like a scorpion&mdash;but all claw&mdash;that
is found upon the common house-fly is not a true
parasite. It likes a ride, and to do it cheap. And
when a fly comes within reach, it lays hold of it with its
disproportionately huge claws, clings, and has a ride,
free, gratis and for nothing. When it has seen enough
of the world and is tired, it lets go and drops off.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Bignell: "The Blossom Underwing is a
moth that was very abundant on the male flowers of the
great sallow on April 13th, 1866. Previously this moth
was very scarce; but on this night I saw at least a
thousand; they were all in pairs, and each pair occupied
a flower, a sight never to be forgotten. The fine
flowering scrubby oaks were swarming with the larvæ.
A friend of mine who kept birds in a very large cage,
seeing the abundance of the caterpillars, decided to give
his birds a treat; he accordingly gathered about a pint
of them, carried them home, and instead of giving the
birds two or three at a time, he incautiously put the
tin into the cage and removed the lid. At once the
caterpillars began to escape, and the seething mass
of black and yellow wriggling over the floor, crawling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
about the wires, so frightened the birds that it caused
the death of two of three, which beat themselves against
the cage in vain hope to escape from these uncanny
horrors."</p>

<p>As may be well imagined, Mr. Bignell with his
lantern stealing up the side of a hedge in the night
often enough routed the poachers and sent them flying,
thinking they were being watched by a policeman.
On one occasion he scared an owl. "I was enjoying
myself, on my knees, hunting over the contents of my
net that I had used for sweeping the low foliage, to see
what captures I had made. My nose and bull's-eye
lantern were thrust close to the ground, to prevent anything
escaping observation. In the midst of this occupation
an owl swooped down to see what was up, when
I turned my lantern on him, and away he flew in a
mighty hurry, bringing the back of his wings together
with great force, like a man clapping his hands. He
was evidently in great alarm, and uttered an unearthly
scream. It certainly gave me also a turn, it was so
sudden."</p>

<p>All moths with highly pectinated antennæ, that is to
say with their feelers comb-like at the extremities, have
the most extraordinary power of scenting a female moth
at a great distance, even two or three miles, with a
favourable wind.</p>

<p>Mr. Bignell says: "I once had a virgin female
of the Oak-egger moth, and was desirous of getting
some males. I started off with the lady in a tin box,
with a perforated zinc top, to give her air and allow her
perfume to escape. I walked through the fields towards
Milehouse to where was a turnstile; and at this spot
lighted on a weary policeman resting. As it was a dull
day, without any token of the sun breaking out, to
attract butterflies for their usual gambols, the policeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
jeeringly remarked that I had missed the right day.
I replied that I thought not, and that I could collect as
many as I desired, in fact, I could make them come to
me. He laughed incredulously. I then took out my
tin box and placed it on the wall, and, magician-like,
whistled and waved my hand. The policeman stared,
and thought I was befooling him. But lo, in two
or three minutes one male alighted close to the box,
soon followed by others, and in a quarter of an hour I
had at least fifty, and so tame that I picked them up
with my fingers and distributed them among about a
dozen people who had gathered to see what I was
about. The policeman stared with open eyes and
mouth, quite satisfied that my whistle and mysterious
signs in the air with my hand had called the insects to
me. Satisfied with what I had got I waved again and
bade the moths depart, and clapped the box in my
pocket. Next day I took the empty box out with me
into the country. I had several males following me, and
some actually penetrated into my pocket where was the
empty box, proving that the perfume still remained in
it, though wholly imperceptible to myself."</p>

<p>On one occasion Mr. Bignell and a friend set out at
night to find the beautiful moth <i>Heliophobus hispidus</i>,
knowing its haunts, between the south side of the
Plymouth citadel and the sea, where it is to be found
in September or October resting on the grass.</p>

<p>Accordingly, each furnished with a bull's-eye lantern,
they visited the locality, but it was some time before
one was discerned, and that was on a blade of grass
overhanging the cliff and out of reach, a sheer drop of
twenty feet at least into the sea fretting and moaning
below. Loath to miss it, as its eyes shone like two
rubies&mdash;in fact, both saw those glistening eyes before
they observed that they were in the head of the moth&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
arranged that one should lie flat on his stomach,
and that Mr. Bignell should sit down, dig the heels of
his boots into the turf, then take his friend by the legs
and thrust him over the edge of the cliff, so far as to
enable him to box the moth, whilst holding the handle
of his lantern between his teeth. This was done, and
the <i>Heliophobus</i> was secured.</p>

<p>But, after all, it is in the direction of parasites living
upon insects that Mr. Bignell has made the greatest
research. He is the possessor of a unique collection
of the parasites that live on the aphis, and also of the
hyper-parasite which preys upon that parasite. The
life-history of this insect was unknown till Mr. Bignell
detected a hyper-parasite pierce the aphis which was
itself a parasite. The specimen was secured, and
from it was bred the hyper-parasite itself.</p>

<p>The life-story of the aphis, that tiny green pest that
infests the roses, has been unrolled by this enthusiastic
student, and is full of surprises. The ichneumon fly
as well has been watched, and all its wicked acts
recorded.</p>

<p>Caterpillars, so fat and fleshy, form a delightful
feeding ground for the deposit of eggs, and serve
as luscious food for the young to pasture upon. We
human beings, in common with all mammals, have the
obligation imposed on us of nourishing our own young,
and with some of us we go on sustaining them till we
are exhausted in the process, but the ichneumonidæ
are more clever than we. They make others, notably
the caterpillars, maintain their young, and the
frivolous mothers, after having once deposited their
eggs, gad about and enjoy themselves as having no
concern for their future well-being. It is a comfort to
reflect that the insects thus preyed upon do not seem to
suffer much, if at all, and it may almost be said that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
exhibit a maternal regard for the young bred out of
their bodies.</p>

<p>With his wonderful microscopes Mr. Bignell can
explore far down the ladder of life, but whether to its
lowest rung may well be doubted. There is always
some living being to be found preying on the last of
the minutest creature last seen.</p>

<p>After a visit to Mr. Bignell's house in Saltash with
a friend, I turned to him and said: "I came here
believing myself to be an Individual. I leave knowing
myself to be a Community."</p>

<h2>SIR JOHN CALL, BART.</h2>


<p>The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> says
of Sir John Call that he was "descended
from an old family which, it is said, once
owned considerable property in Devon and
Cornwall." That proviso "it is said" is conveniently
inserted. Anything may be said, as that the cow
jumped over the moon, but that a saying may be
believed we must know who uttered it. Now the
originator of this saying was probably William Playfair,
in his <i>British Family Antiquity</i>, 1809. In that the following
interesting statement occurs: "From papers in
the possession of the family, partly fabulous, though
partly true, it appears that the family of the Calls,
consisting of three brothers, came into England from
Saxony towards the end of the eighth century. One
of these brothers settled in Scotland, from whom is
descended the clan of the McColls; the second in
Norfolk, where the family continued until the beginning
of the last (eighteenth) century; and the third
settled in Cornwall, from whence the present family
derives its origin. This very ancient, but latterly not
very opulent family, was formerly possessed of considerable
landed property both in Devonshire and
Cornwall, which was first reduced by the civil wars
in the time of Henry VII, and afterwards nearly
annihilated, in consequence of the loyal attachment
of some of its individuals to the royal cause during
the civil wars in the reign of Charles I."</p>

   <p class="caption2">SIR JOHN CALL, BART.<br />
<i>From a portrait (by A. Hickle) in the possession of his great-granddaughter,
Mrs. de Lacy Lacy</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Why was the eighth century fixed on for the advent
of the Calls upon the scene? Presumably because the
first Norsemen arrived in 787. Conceive the Calls
coming over in a dragon ship, filled with berserker
rage, to ravage England and glut themselves with our
blood.</p>

<p>But we shall look for Calls in vain among the records
of the past. As it happens, Saxons and Northmen had
no family, only personal names. The story is as absurd
as that also put forth that Callington derived its name
from the Calls, who only settled near it in 1770.</p>

<p>But these "family papers" are not so ancient as Sir
John Call, who would have been above such a pretence.
As a matter of fact, the account supplied to Playfair
shows a surprising ignorance in the writer as to the
existence of Heralds' Visitations, Inquisitiones post
mortem, Wills, Royalist Composition Papers, Parish
Registers, and all the material at hand to confirm or
disprove reckless genealogical assertions. Playfair
does admit that the story contained in the "family
papers" is "partly fabulous." He might have said
that it was fabulous from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The Calls had no right whatever to bear arms, till
a grant was made to them&mdash;after reading the above
flourish not inappropriate&mdash;of three trumpets.</p>

<p>The MS. "Names of Gentlemen in Devonshire and
Cornwall with their Arms," drawn up by John Hooker,
<i>alias</i> Vowell, in 1599, is the only armoury of the West
that gives the name of Call with arms: Party per pale
or and gules; upon a chief az. 3 geese sable. But he
gives no indication of place where such a gentleman
possessed land&mdash;and that, before this "opulent family"
had been ruined by the civil wars. Hooker probably
included the name, because, at the time, there was some
gentleman Call from another part of England living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in Exeter. That the Calls of Whiteford had no claim to
his arms, nor could exhibit descent from him, is shown
by their not adopting his coat. In a MS. armoury
of all England dating from 1632, that belonged to
C. Pole, the name and arms of Call do not occur.</p>

<p>According to Foster's <i>Baronetage</i>, the Calls hailed
from Prestacott, in Launcells.</p>

<p>Actually the great-grandfather of Sir John was of
Grove, in Stratton, a tenant farmer. A good many
Calls appear in the register of the parish, never with
<i>gent.</i> appended to the name, or even with Mr. preceding
it, a title generally accorded to a yeoman or a
well-to-do tradesman; and one in 1735 is buried as a
pauper. Their marriages also show to what class they
belonged, with the Uglows, Tanners, and the Jewells,
in a humble walk of life.</p>

<p>John Call, described as of Prestacott, in Launcells,
was born in 1680, and in 1702 married Sarah Jewell,
and died in 1730.</p>

<p>Prestacott consisted of three very small farms on the
right-hand side of the old road from Stratton to Holsworthy.
Of late years the ramshackle buildings have
been pulled down and the lands thrown together and
constituted one farm, and a new house has been built.
It belonged at the time that John Call rented one of
these little holdings to the Orchards of Hartland
Abbey. John Call had two sons, John and Richard.
John was born 1st March, 1704-5, and married Jane,
daughter of John Mill, of Launcells, "the descendant
of a respectable family, which had considerable possessions
there, as well as in Middlesex," says Playfair.
He might have added with equal truth that they possessed
castles in the air. As it happens, the Visitations
of Cornwall and Lysons knew nothing of the family of
Mill. The Mills were of Shernick, a farm in Launcells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
which they rented of the Arundels of Trerice. Their
ledger-stones are in the parish church, but they are
never described as <i>gents.</i> Mrs. Judith Mill was buried
on October 14th, 1723, and Mr. John Mill on December
1st in the same year, and Mr. Richard Mill on July
11th, 1766.</p>

<p>Sarah Call, widow of John Call (without even Mr.
and Mrs. prefixed), was buried on February 1st, 1747-8.
Shernick is now the property of Sir C. T. Acland,
Bart., inherited through an heiress in the nineteenth
century of the Arundels.</p>

<p>John Call, who married Jane Mill, had a son, the
subject of this memoir. Afterwards, when this son
was rich, he set up a tablet to the memory of his father
in Launcells Church, on which he gives him the title of
"gent."</p>

<p>In Memory of John Call gent of Shernick
in this parish, and of Whiteford in Stoke Climsland.
He was interred in this church 3 Jan. 1767,
aged 63. Also of Jane Call his widow, who
was interred 9 Nov. 1781, aged 70.
Also of Jane Jones their daughter, wife of
the Rev<sup>d</sup> Cadwalader Jones, minister of this parish,
who was here interred 2 April, 1790, aged
50, and of their two children, etc.</p>

<p>Concerning Mrs. Cadwalader Jones, more hereafter.
The old gentleman, John Call, had died on December
31st, 1766, going out with the old year.</p>

<p>John, the younger, was born June 30th, 1732, at
Fenny Park, near Tiverton, and was educated at a
private school. For some reason or other, not known,
his mother disliked him, and when aged seventeen, and
he had been recommended to the notice of Benjamin
Robbins, who was going out to India, she refused
to furnish him with the money required for his outfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and passage to India, so that his more distant relatives,
probably the Mill family of Shernick, supplied the
money.</p>

<p>Benjamin Robbins had composed a treatise on the
principles of gunnery and the price of gunpowder, that
was not as yet published, and also an account of Lord
Anson's voyages. He was a mathematician, and had
been appointed chief engineer and captain-general in
the East India Company's service, and he was looking
about for commercial clerks who would serve on a
small pay, when Call was recommended to him as a
shrewd lad. John Call was glad of the chance of seeing
something of the world and of escaping from a
mother who flouted him, and he embraced the offer
with gladness. Robbins quitted England in 1749, and
arrived with his clerks at Fort William in July, 1750.</p>

<p>Call had been given by Robbins his treatise on explosives
to transcribe for the press, and this interested
the young man in the subject, and he pursued the
theme, and made considerable improvements in rifling
barrels. He also introduced one that enabled shells
to be discharged from long guns. When Robbins
landed he had with him eight young clerks, of whom
Call was one. Robbins died in July, 1751, and Call
then became the leading engineer.</p>

<p>War broke out among the native princes, backed
up upon one side by the French, on the other by the
English, and Call was employed to carry out the erection
of defensive works at Fort S. David. This was an
English settlement near the mouth of the Southern
Pennair River, and was only twelve miles from Pondicherry,
the French head-quarters.</p>

<p>Madras, at the mouth of the Triplicane, consisted
of the native or black city and of Fort S. George,
which lay on the sea, and was almost engirdled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
North River that with the Triplicane formed an island
crossed by the main road from Chinglapett and Vandalone.</p>

<p>The French, whilst in possession of Fort S. George,
after it had been taken by Labourdonnais in 1746, had
made several improvements and additions to the slight
works they found, which, nevertheless, rendered the
fort little capable of long resistance against the regular
approaches of a European enemy; nor had they
given any attention to the internal area, which did not
exceed fifteen acres of ground. Nevertheless, the
English let the place remain in the same state after its
recovery from the French in 1751 till the beginning of
the year 1756, when the expectation of another war
with that nation, and the reports of the great preparations
making in France against India, dictated the
necessity of rendering it completely defensible; and
Call was employed in the extension and perfecting of
the work, that had received the consideration of
Robbins before his decease. Accordingly all the
coolies, labourers, and tank diggers whom the adjacent
country could supply were from this time
constantly employed on the fortifications: their daily
number generally amounted to four thousand men,
women, and children. The river channel was diverted,
and the old channel was filled up; very extensive
bastions and outworks were erected; and it was due to
this undertaking that Fort S. George was able to stand
successfully against the siege by the Count de Lally in
1759.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1752 Call accompanied
Captain (afterwards Lord) Clive in an expedition
against the French, who had possessed themselves of
the province of Arcot, and were plundering up to the
very gates of Madras; and he was with him in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
occupation and subsequent defence of Arcot, during a
fifty days' siege. Clive had marched from Madras
with two hundred English soldiers and three hundred
sepoys. He had with him eight English officers, but
of these only two had smelt powder, whilst four, Call
among them, were only commercial clerks forced by
Clive's example to draw the sword. The battle of
Coverplank, near Arcot, gained by Captain Clive in
the February of 1752, in which the French lost all their
artillery and were totally dispersed, cleared the province
of their influence and established the English in
the garrison of that capital. From Arcot the victorious
army, consisting of about five hundred Europeans
and one thousand natives, marched through the
country back to Fort S. David, when Mr. Call was
appointed chief engineer at Madras, and eventually of
all the Coromandel coast.</p>

<p>In 1753 the French under Bussy and Dupleix were
full of schemes to retrieve the honour of their arms,
and to obtain the absolute empire of the Deccan and the
south. In that year, the cession of five important
provinces had made them masters of the sea-coast of
Coromandel and Orissa for an uninterrupted line of
six hundred miles, and also furnished the convenient
means of receiving reinforcements of men and military
stores from Pondicherry and Mauritius. But neither
the Court of Versailles nor the French India Company
at home had approved the grand projects of Bussy and
Dupleix. The Court questioned the propriety of these
wars with the English in a time of peace, and the
Company was impatient at the cost of these wars, and
doubted whether the territorial acquisitions could be
maintained profitably to themselves. The English
Company also was impatient at the heavy outlay, and
was willing to leave the French in possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Northern Circars; but Dupleix was not to be restrained.
He saw further into the future than did the
merchants of Paris; he perceived that an unrivalled
opportunity was open to him to make all India tributary
to France, and he was determined to seize it. But
to do so he must expel the English. He claimed to be
Nabob of the Carnatic, and unless his authority as such
were recognized by the English, he would make no
terms whatever with them. But Dupleix had had his
day. His protectors and admirers were now out of
office, and he was recalled to France.</p>

<p>As soon as war had been declared in Europe, the
Government of Louis XV commenced preparations on
a large scale for an expedition to the East, and the
arrival of a great armament was daily expected at
Pondicherry.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until 28th April, 1758, that
a squadron of twelve vessels reached the coast. These
ships had on board a regiment of infantry eleven hundred
strong, a corps of artillery, and a number of
officers, all under the command of the Count de Lally,
a veteran officer of Irish extraction, who had been all
his life in the service of France. He had been appointed
Governor-General of the French possessions
in India. He was a man of great ability and ambition,
and was animated by intense and passionate hatred of
England. Had he been supported from home, he would
almost certainly have made France predominant in the
peninsula. No sooner was he landed than he organized
an expedition against Fort S. David, and in June, 1758,
he captured it. He then prepared to take Madras as a
preliminary to an advance on Bengal, and he hoped to
drive the English out of Calcutta. But he was without
resources; there was no money to be had at Pondicherry.
At last he raised a small sum, chiefly out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
his own funds, and began the march to Madras; his
officers preferring to risk death before the walls of
Madras to certain starvation within the walls of Pondicherry.
Lally reached Madras on the 12th December,
1758, and at once took possession of the black or
native town, commanded by Fort S. George, and
began the siege of that fort with vigour. Call was
within. It was due to him that the defences were
in such a condition that the garrison could look
with confidence to withstand a siege. We hear, indeed,
nothing of any active part taken by him during
the progress of the siege, but undoubtedly his knowledge
and talent had much to do with rendering the
defence effective. The real command was with Major
Laurence and Mr. Pigot. The total force collected was
1758 Europeans and 2220 sepoys. On the other side
Lally had an army of 2700 Europeans and 4000 native
troops.</p>

<p>On 14th December the French took possession of
the black town, which was open and defenceless; and
there the soldiers, breaking open some arrack stores,
got drunk and mad, and committed great disorders.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this, a sortie was resolved
upon, and six hundred chosen men, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Draper and Major Brereton,
with two field-pieces, rushed into the streets of the
black town. Unluckily the drummers, who were all
little black boys, struck up the "Grenadiers' March"
too soon and gave warning to the French, who left off
their drinking and plundering, and, running to their
arms, drew up at a point where the narrow streets
crossed at right angles. Those who were drunk were
joined by those who were sober, till the whole number
far exceeded that of the English detachment. If Bussy,
who was at hand, had made one of the bold and rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
movements which he had been accustomed to make
when acting on his own responsibility, he might have
taken the English in rear. But he was sulky, and
jealous of Lally, and remained inert. When Draper
saw that he must retreat, he found that all his
drummer-boys who should sound the recall had run
away. He, however, managed to bring off his troops,
leaving two field-pieces behind, and having lost or
killed, wounded and prisoners, about two hundred
men.</p>

<p>The siege dragged on. Most of Lally's heavy artillery
was still at sea, and a corps of sepoys captured
and spiked his only 13-inch mortar, which was coming
by land. All his warlike means were as deficient
as those of the garrison were perfect, and dissensions
and ill-will against him increased among his
officers.</p>

<p>For six weeks the French were without any pay, and
during the last fifteen days they had no provisions except
rice and butter. Then the ammunition of the
besiegers failed. On the 15th February, 1759, he resolved
on raising the siege. He had thrown away his
last bomb three weeks before, and he had blazed away
nearly all his gunpowder. Pouring forth invectives
and blaming every one but himself, Lally decamped on
the night of the 17th as secretly and expeditiously as
he could.</p>

<p>In March, 1760, Call was employed in reducing
Karikal, and at the latter end of the year and in the
beginning of 1761 he was employed as chief engineer
under Sir Eyre Coote in the reduction of Pondicherry,
which, after it had been battered furiously during two
days, surrendered at discretion. Then the town and
fortifications were levelled with the ground. A few
weeks after the strong hill-fortress of Gingi surrendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and the military power of the French in the
Carnatic was brought to an end.</p>

<p>In 1762 Call had the good fortune, when serving
under General Cailland, to effect the reduction of the
strong fortress of Vellore, one hundred miles west of
Madras, which has since been the <i>point d'appui</i> of the
English power in the Carnatic.</p>

<p>In July, 1763, Mahomed Usuff Cawn, a native of
great military talent, employed in the service of the
English, for usurping the government of Madura and
Tinnevelly, the two southernmost provinces of the
peninsula, had to be dealt with summarily. A considerable
force marched against him, under the command
of Colonel Monson, of His Majesty's 69th
Regiment. Call acted as chief engineer under him,
till the heavy rains in October obliged the English
army to retire from before Madura. Eventually that
place and Palamata were reduced, and Mahomed Usuff
Cawn was taken and hanged.</p>

<p>At the latter end of 1764 Call went into the Travancore
country to settle with the Rajah for the arrears of
tribute due to the Nabob of Arcot. Having satisfactorily
accomplished that business and other concerns
with southern princes, he returned to Madras in
January, 1765, and took his seat at the Civil Council,
to which he was entitled by rotation, and he obtained
the rank of colonel.</p>

<p>During a great part of the war with Hyder Ali in
1767 and 1768 Call accompanied the army into the
Mysore country, and whilst he was there the Company
advanced him to the third seat in the Council, and he
was strongly recommended by Lord Clive to succeed
to the government of Madras on the first vacancy.
But news reached him of the death of his father, and
he made up his mind to return to England. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
managed to scrape together a very considerable fortune,
and he desired to spend the rest of his days in the
enjoyment of it. He embarked on February 8th, 1770,
after a service of nearly twenty years, and he landed at
Plymouth on July 26th.</p>

   <p class="caption2">WHITEFORD. THE RESIDENCE OF SIR JOHN CALL<br />
<i>From a drawing in the possession of Mrs. de Lacy Lacy</i></p>
</div>

<p>He bought Whiteford, in the parish of Stoke Climsland,
and greatly enlarged the house. In 1771 he was
appointed Sheriff of Cornwall, and in March, 1772,
he married Philadelphia, third daughter of Wm.
Battye, <span class="smcap">m.d.</span>, a somewhat distinguished physician
living in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>From this period till the autumn of 1782 he lived in
retirement at Whiteford.</p>

<p>Whilst in India, Call had not forgotten his parents
and sister at home, and had sent to his mother priceless
Indian shawls, which she, not knowing their value, cut
up and turned into under-petticoats for herself and
daughter and maids. A pipe of Madeira sent to the
father was also as little appreciated. It was distributed
among the farm-labourers during harvest time to
economize the cider.</p>

<p>Now that he was in England and wealthy, he resolved
on doing something for his sister. She had
married Cadwalader Jones, the vicar of the parish, and
the vicarage was a small, mean building, so Cadwalader
Jones had taken the manor house that was near the
church on a long lease from the Orchards, who were
lords of the manor. This house had been a cell of
Hartland Abbey, but at the Restoration had been given
to the Chammonds. That family had died out, and
now it had come to the Orchards, owners of Hartland
Abbey. Call rebuilt the house, or, to be more exact,
built on a modern house to the old, and installed Cadwalader
and his sister in the new mansion; he also
made for them a large walled garden. When he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
this, he was under the impression that the property
belonged to Cadwalader, and not till he had completed
his building did he learn that Mr. Jones had only a
lease of it. Moreover, Mrs. Jones did not live to enjoy
the new house very long, as she died in 1780, and then
Cadwalader married again. In course of time Cadwalader
went to join his ancestors, and thereupon Mr.
Hawkey saw and loved the widow and the mansion,
and married her. Thus it came about that the manor
house built for Mrs. Jane Jones passed into other
hands. But thus it happens also that through Miss
Charlotte Hawkey we have some account of Sir John
Call.</p>

<p>Lord Shelburne, when Prime Minister, being desirous
of investigating some of the existing abuses and reforming
some of the public departments, fixed on Call
and engaged him along with Mr. Arthur Holdsworth,
of Dartmouth, to inquire into the state and management
of Crown lands, woods, and forests, which had
long been neglected; Call had seen this with regard to
the Duchy property at his doors, and had drawn attention
to it. In November, 1782, they made their first
report; but a change of Ministry taking place soon
after, their proceedings were interrupted till the Duke
of Portland, then First Lord of the Treasury, authorized
them to continue their investigation. Before they had
gone far another change took place in the Ministry,
and Pitt became Prime Minister. These frequent
interruptions interfered with the progress of the investigation,
and to obviate that, in 1785-6 Sir Charles
Middleton, Call, and Holdsworth were appointed permanent
Parliamentary Commissioners.</p>

<p>Call became a banker, a manufacturer of plate-glass,
and a copper-smelter. He designed and saw to the
execution of the Bodmin gaol in 1779. He was elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
M. P. for Callington in 1784, and retained his seat till
1801. On July 28th, 1791, he was created a baronet,
and granted as his arms, <i>gules</i>, <i>three trumpets fessewise
in pale, or</i>; as crest, a <i>demi-lion ramp. holding between
the paws a trumpet erect, or</i>.</p>

<p>By his wife he had six children. In 1785 he purchased
the famous house of Field-Marshal Wade, in
Old Burlington Street. He became totally blind in
1795, and died of apoplexy at his residence in town on
March 1st, 1801, and was succeeded in the baronetcy
by his son, William Pratt Call, who died in 1851,
leaving a son, William Berkeley Call, the third baronet,
who died in 1864, and with the son of this latter, Sir
William George Montague Call, the fourth baronet,
the title became extinct. It will be noticed that the
two last affected aristocratic Christian names, Berkeley
and Montague. Whiteford was sold to the Duchy of
Cornwall, and all the noble trees in the park were cut
down and turned into money, and the mansion converted
into an office for the Duchy. Davies Gilbert, in
his <i>Parochial History of Cornwall</i>, tells a couple of
anecdotes of Sir John, but they are too pointless to
merit repetition.</p>

<p>Call was one of those admirable, self-made men who
have been empire-makers in the East, and, better than
that, have been makers of the English name as
synonymous with all that is powerful and true and just.
He well deserved the title accorded to him. He was a
man of whom Cornwall may be proud, and it needed
no trumpets in his arms and fictions about the origin of
his family to make the name honourable.</p>

<p>As Dr. Johnson said, "There are some families
like potatoes, whose only good parts are underground."</p>

<p>The authorities for the life of Sir John Call are Playfair's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>

Markham's <i>Memoir on the Indian Surveys</i>, 1878; H.
G. Nicholl's <i>Forest of Dean</i>; and <i>Neota</i>, by Charlotte
Hawkey, 1871.</p>

1795, is now in the Museum of the Royal Institution
of Cornwall, at Truro.</p>

<h2>JOHN KNILL</h2>


<p>In August, 1853, appeared the following account
in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An eccentric old gentleman of the name
Knill, a private secretary some fifty or sixty
years ago to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, becoming
afterwards collector of the port of S. Ives, built
a three-sided pyramid of granite on the top of a high
hill, near the town of S. Ives. The pyramid is represented
as a pocket edition of an Egyptian one, and in
it this gentleman caused a chamber to be built, with a
stone coffin, giving out his intention to be buried there,
and leaving a charge on an estate to the corporation of
S. Ives for the maintenance and repair, etc., of the
pyramid. He, however, died in London; and by his
latest will, so far from perpetuating the ostentatious
idea, desired that his body should be given up to the
surgeons for dissection, a penance, it is supposed, for
past follies, after which the remains were buried in
London. The pyramid, however, still stands as a
landmark. On one side, in raised letters in granite,
appear the words 'Hic jacet nil.' It was understood
that the 'K' and another 'l' would be added when the
projector should be placed within; and on the other
side, 'Ex nihilo nil fit,' to be filled up in like manner,
Knill. The mausoleum obtained then, and still bears
the name of Knill's Folly."</p>

<p>This account, full of inaccuracies, called forth a
letter to the editor from a relative of John Knill, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Penrose, by Helston, dated October, 1853, which
appeared in the November issue of the same magazine.
He stated that John Knill was educated for the law,
but did not adopt it as a profession. He preferred to
accept the office of collector of customs at S. Ives.
After a while he was sent as Inspector-General of
Customs to the West Indies, whence he returned to his
duties at S. Ives, after having discharged his office of
inspectorship. In 1777 the Earl of Buckinghamshire,
who was recorder of S. Ives, invited Mr. Knill to
accompany him to Ireland as his private secretary,
when he, the earl, had been made lord-lieutenant.
The offer was accepted.</p>

<p>In 1782, thirty years before his death, he erected the
mausoleum, partly actuated by a philanthropic motive
as affording a landmark to ships approaching the
port, and partly by a wish to find employment for
men at a time of considerable distress, having also
a desire to be buried there, if the ground could be
consecrated. This intention was afterwards abandoned.</p>

<p>Mr. Knill resided for some years previous to his
death in Gray's Inn, and was a bencher of that
society. He died there in 1811, and was buried in
the vaults of S. Andrew's, Holborn. On one side of the
monument is the word "Resurgam." On the second
side, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," and on
the third is no inscription at all, and the silly puns
given by the informant of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
had no existence save in the imagination of the
correspondent.</p>

<p>The same writer adds: "Though he had a wide
circle of acquaintances and he was highly esteemed
by all who knew him, he resisted every invitation to
dine in private society, and for many years past dined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
at Dolly's Coffee House, Paternoster Row, walking
through the chief avenues of the town in the course of
the day, in order to meet his friends and to preserve
his health by moderate exercise."</p>

   <p class="caption2">JOHN KNILL<br />
<i>After a picture by Opie in the possession of Captain Rogers of Penrose</i></p>
</div>

<p>We are able to supplement this scanty record from
a memoir of him by Mr. John Jope Rogers, of Penrose,
published in 1871 by Cunnack, of Helston.</p>

<p>John Knill was born at Callington on January 1st,
1733. His mother was a Pike of Plympton, and her
mother was an Edgcumbe of Edgcumbe, it is stated in
the memoir, but no entry of any such marriage is in
the pedigree of the Edgcumbes in Vivian's <i>Heralds'
Visitations of Devon</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Knill was very desirous to trace a descent from
the family of Knill of Knill, in Hereford, but entirely
failed to do so.</p>

<p>John Knill's mother, one of the seven daughters of
Mr. Pike, married secondly Mr. Jope, and it is thus
that the portrait of the subject of this memoir came into
the possession of Mr. John Jope Rogers, of Penrose,
author of the memoir.</p>

<p>John Knill, according to Davies Gilbert, "served his
clerkship as an attorney in Penzance, and from thence
removed to the office of a London attorney, where,
having distinguished himself by application and intelligence,
he was recommended to the Earl of Buckinghamshire,
who, at that time, held the political
interests of S. Ives, to be his local agent." In the year
1762 he was appointed collector of customs at S. Ives,
in Cornwall, and held it during twenty years, at the end
of which time he wrote to Mr. William Praed, March
30th, 1782: "I purpose to be in London in May,
in order to resign my office of collector, which I
shall finally quit at the end of next midsummer
quarter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1767, he was chosen mayor of S. Ives,
and lived in a red-brick house facing the beach, in Fore
Street. Although mayor and collector of customs, it
was strongly believed that he was in league with
smugglers and wreckers.</p>

<p>One day, during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, a strange vessel ran on the rocks on the Hayle
side of Carrick Gladden, and the crew escaped to land
and disappeared. The ship, now a derelict, had
apparently no owner, and next day a number of people
boarded her, and found her full of chinaware and other
smuggled goods. The ship's papers could not be
found; they had been carried off when the crew deserted
her, and it was strongly supposed that they were destroyed,
as implicating Knill and Praed, of Trevetho.
The customs officer, Roger Wearne, went on board
and stuffed his clothes full of china; having a pair of
trousers on with a very ample and baggy seat, he
thought he could not do better than stow away some of
the choicest pieces of porcelain there. But as he was
getting down the side of the ship into the boat, very
leisurely, so as not to injure his spoils, a comrade,
getting impatient, struck him on the posteriors with the
blade of his oar, shouting to him, "Look out sharp,
Wearne!" and was startled at the cracking noise that
ensued, and the howl of Wearne when the broken
splinters of china entered his flesh.</p>

<p>In 1773 the Government sent him to Jamaica to
inspect the ports there; he remained in the West
Indies one year, and used his eyes and ears, for in 1779
he wrote an account of the religion of the Coromandel
negroes for Bryant Edwards' <i>History of the West Indies</i>,
from information he then and there gathered. For his
services he received from the Board of Customs the
substantial sum of £1500. He returned to his duties at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
S. Ives in 1774. In 1777 he became private secretary
to the Earl of Buckinghamshire, in Dublin, but he
returned to S. Ives after six months in Ireland. In
1779 he speculated in a bootless search for treasure,
which the notorious pirate, Captain John Avery, was
supposed, on his return from Madagascar, to have
secreted near the Lizard. But, as none of the Lives of
that freebooter gave any hint of his having done so,
the attempt was not the least likely to lead to satisfactory
results. Davies Gilbert says that Knill equipped some
small vessels to act as privateers against smugglers,
but if local tradition may be relied on, these vessels
were only nominally for this purpose, and were actually
engaged in running contraband goods; but this is
highly improbable.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1782 he was employed in the service of the
customs as inspector of some of the western ports,
making occasional visits to London, where he settled
for the rest of his days. In 1784 he purchased
chambers in Gray's Inn Square, where he died on
March 29th, 1811, at the age of seventy-seven. He
was painted by Opie in 1779, dressed in a plain
suit of blue, with frilled shirt and ruffles. He made
his half-brother, the Rev. John Jope, of S. Cleer, his
sole executor.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1782 that John Knill erected his
mausoleum on Worral Hill, on land purchased from
Henry, Lord Arundell, for five guineas. The total
cost of the monument was £226 1s. 6d. Sixpence a
year is paid to the owner of Tregenna for a right of
way to the obelisk. By a deed dated May 29th, 1797,
Knill settled upon the mayor and capital burgesses of
S. Ives, and their successors for ever, an annuity of
£10 as a rent-charge, to be paid out of the manor
of Glivian, in Mawgan, which sum is annually to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
put into a chest which is not to be opened except at the
end of every five years. Then, out of the accumulated
sum, a dinner was to be given to the mayor, collector
of customs, and vicar of S. Ives, and two friends to be
invited by each of them, and £15 to be equally divided
among ten girls, natives of S. Ives, under ten years
old, who should, between 10 a.m. and noon on S.
James the Apostle's Day, dance and sing round the
mausoleum, to the fiddling of a man who was to
receive a pound for so doing and for fiddling as the
procession of girls went to the obelisk and returned.
One pound was to be laid out in white ribbons for the
damsels and a cockade for the fiddler. Some of the
money was to go to keep the mausoleum in repair, and
there were certain benefactions also recorded.</p>

<p>The first Knillian celebration took place in July,
1801, when, according to the will of the founder, a
band of little girls, all dressed in white, with two
widows and a company of musicians, marched in procession
to the top of the hill, where they danced about
the monument, then, as Knill desired, sang the Hundredth
Psalm to its old melody, and after that returned
in the same order to S. Ives. The ceremony still takes
place every fifth year.</p>

<p>In dancing the children sing the following in chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>THOMAS TREGOSS</h2>


<p>A certain Roscadden going on a pilgrimage in
the days before the Reformation, and being
absent some years, was surprised on his
return to find that his wife had borne one
if not more children. Very much and very naturally
put out, he consulted with one John Tregoss, who
advised him to settle his estate upon some friend whom
he could trust, for the use and benefit of his children
whom he would own, and for the wife not to be left
absolutely destitute in the event of his death. Mr.
Roscadden approved of this counsel, and constituted
John Tregoss his heir absolutely, but always with the
understanding that the said Tregoss should administer
his estate according to the wishes and instructions of
Roscadden. But this gentleman dying soon after, John
Tregoss entered on possession of the estate, "turned
the wife and children out of doors, who for some time
were fain to lye in an hog-stye, and every morning
went forth to the Dung-hill, and there upon their faces
imprecated and prayed that the vengeance of God might
fall upon Tregoss and his posterity for this so perfidious
and merciless deed.</p>

<p>"And after this, God's severe but righteous judgments
fell upon Tregoss's family. For his son Walter,
one day riding upon a Horse in a fair way, the horse
threw him, and broke his neck: and some of his issue
came to untimely ends, and it is observed that a curse
hath remained ever since: and this Mr. Tregoss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
whom we write was so sensible of it, that it cost him
many fervent prayers to God for the removal of that
dreadful curse, as himself assured a bosom friend"&mdash;but
it does not seem to have occurred to him to give up
the heritage to the Roscaddens&mdash;that is, if he were the
possessor.</p>

<p>The family of Tregose, or Tregosse, was one of the
oldest in the neighbourhood of S. Ives. The names
of Clement and John Tregose of S. Ives appear in the
Subsidy Roll of 1327. In the list of <i>circa</i> 1520, Thomas
Tregoos' lands in Towednack were assessed at the
yearly value of 13s. 4d., and those of John Tregoz, in
the parish of S. Ives, at 11s.; but Thomas also had lands
at S. Ives, valued the same as those of John.</p>

<p>In 1641, William Tregose, gent., had at S. Ives
goods to the annual value of £3.</p>

<p>Thomas Tregoss, the subject of this notice, was the
son of William Tregoss of S. Ives. His parents were
strong Puritans and very austere, and they hedged
about their son with restrictions, not suffering him to
partake in games or any childish relaxations from the
strain of study or the contemplation of religious themes.
At first he seemed to be of poor capacity, but at the age
of seven years he began to show that he had a quick
apprehension and a retentive memory. Cut off from all
worldly distractions, he was allowed but one direction
in which his faculties and his ambitions could stretch
and expand. He had not the force of character and
strength of will to revolt against the numbing restraints
that bound him in. His only play as a boy was
standing on a chair and preaching to his fellow
pupils.</p>

<p>He was sent to Oxford and admitted into Exeter
College, and after a few years spent there, returned to
S. Ives; and as the Parliamentary Commissioners had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
ejected the vicar, he was thrust in as Puritan preacher
in 1657, and he then married a Margaret Sparrow of
the same way of thinking.</p>

<p>The life of Thomas Tregoss, as given by Samuel
Clark in his <i>Lives of Some Eminent Persons</i>, 1683,
is interspersed with Remarkable Providences and Extraordinary
Judgments, but for the most part they are
neither remarkable nor interesting.</p>

<p>The following is, perhaps, an exception:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival at S. Ives, in the summer,
the greater portion of the fishing season had passed
without the pilchards appearing, and this to the great
distress of the people. By the advice of Tregoss a day
was set apart for humiliation and prayer, and next day
a shoal of pilchards arrived.</p>

<p>In the ensuing summer the fishermen, having taken
a great number of fishes on the Saturday, wanted to
spread and dry their nets on the Sunday. Tregoss
learning this, came forth and rebuked and denounced
God's judgment on them if they should profane the
"Sabbath" in this manner. They did not hearken to
him, observing that their nets must be dried or would
rot. From that day no more pilchards visited the bay
during that season.</p>

<p>From S. Ives Tregoss was transferred to Mylor
in October, 1659, but was ejected from the living on
August 24th, 1660, as not ordained, and unwilling
to receive ordination, and to subscribe to the articles
and confirm to the liturgy. However, he continued
to preach to a privately assembled number of puritanically
minded people, and he was proceeded
against and committed to the custody of the marshal
in Launceston gaol, where he remained for three
months, and was then released by order of the Deputy
Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>In September, 1663, he removed to Kigilliath, near
Penryn. On October 1st, 1664, whilst he and his wife
were lying awake in bed, they experienced an earthquake
shock, and this he held to be "a symbolick
image of that trembling Heartquake which he shortly
felt in his conversion."</p>

<p>On January 1st ensuing, he fell into deep despondency
and the spirit of bondage&mdash;his liver being probably
out of order&mdash;till he fancied himself relieved by
receiving the spirit of adoption. He had been converted
half a dozen times before, but never before
preceded by an earthquake, so that there could be no
mistake about its reality this time.</p>

<p>Fired with new zeal, he broke into Mabe church at
the head of a number of his adherents, mounted the
pulpit, and harangued his congregation. For this he
was arrested and imprisoned again in Launceston gaol,
but was shortly released, July 29th, 1665; and he had
the pleasing satisfaction of knowing that a bull had
gored Justice Thomas Robinson, who had sent him to
prison.</p>

<p>Undeterred by what he had gone through, he again
invaded Mabe church, and was again committed to
gaol on September 18th, but was once more released,
on December 14th.</p>

<p>On February 4th, 1666, he once more broke into the
parish church of Mabe at the head of a body of
Puritans, and was again arrested and sent to the
marshal at Bodmin, but by the order of the King was
at once set free.</p>

<p>In 1669 he was at Great Torrington, where he
preached, and was sent to Exeter gaol, but was at once
bailed out. He died at Penryn in January, 1672.</p>

<p>On September 4th, 1775, John Wesley preached at
S. Ives "in the little meadow above the town." He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wrote in his diary that "the people in general here
(excepting the rich) seem almost persuaded to be
Christians. Perhaps the prayer of their old pastor,
Mr. Tregoss, is answered even to the fourth generation."</p>

West," was born in the manor house,
Stratton, the son of a tenant farmer, under
the Grenvilles of Stowe. The registers do
not go back sufficiently far to record the date of his
birth. The Tree Inn is the ancient manor house in
which the giant first saw the light. He rapidly shot
up to preternatural size and strength. So vast were
his proportions as a boy, that his schoolmates were
accustomed to work out their arithmetic lessons in
chalk on his back, and sometimes even thereon to
delineate a map of the world, so that he might return
home, like Atlas, carrying the world on his shoulders
for his father with a stick to dust out.</p>

<p>It was his delight to tuck two urchins under his
arms, one on each side, and climb, so encumbered with
"his kittens," as he called them, to a height overhanging
the sea, to their infinite terror, and this he
would call "showing them the world." A proverb
still extant in Cornwall, expressive of some unusual
length, is "As long as Tony Payne's foot."</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one he was taken into the
establishment at Stowe. He then measured seven
feet two inches in height without his shoes, and he
afterwards grew two inches higher. He was not tall
and lanky, but stout and well proportioned in every
way. The original mansion of the Grenvilles at Stowe
still in part remains as a farmhouse. The splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
house of Stowe, built by the first Earl of Bath, was
pulled down shortly after 1711, and it was said that
men lived who had seen the stately palace raised and
also levelled with the dust. This was at a little distance
further inland than the old Stowe that remains.
The Grenvilles had also a picturesque house at Broom
Hill, near Bude, with fine Elizabethan plaster-work
ceilings, now converted into labourers' cottages.</p>

<p>At Stowe Anthony Payne delighted in exhibiting
his strength. In the hurling-ground a rough block
of stone is still pointed out as "Payne's cast," lying
full ten paces beyond the reach whereat the ordinary
player could "put the stone."</p>

<p>It is said that one Christmas Eve the fire languished
in the hall. A boy with an ass had been sent into the
wood for faggots. Payne went to hurry him back,
and caught up the ass and his burden, flung them over
his shoulder, and brought both into the hall and cast
them down by the side of the fire.</p>

<p>On another occasion, being defied to perform the
feat, he carried a bacon-hog from Kilkhampton to
Stowe. Then came the Civil War, when Charles I
and his Parliament sought to settle their differences
on the battlefield. Cornwall went for the King, and
Anthony Payne had the drilling and man&#339;uvring of
the recruits from Kilkhampton and Stratton. At one
time Sir Beville Grenville had his head-quarters at
Truro, but the great battle of Stamford Hill, May 16th,
1643, was fought but eight miles from Stowe, and on
the night preceding it Sir Beville Grenville slept
in his house at Broom Hill. The battle was desperate,
the Royalist soldiers being outnumbered,
and attacked; amidst them was Anthony Payne,
mounted on his sturdy cob Samson, rallying his
troopers and terrorizing the enemy, who fled. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the next pitched battle at Lansdown, near Bath, the
forces of the King were defeated and Sir Beville was
killed. Anthony Payne, having mounted John Grenville,
then a youth of sixteen, on his father's horse, had
led on the Grenville troops to the fight. The Rev.
R. S. Hawker gives a letter from the giant to Lady
Grace Grenville, conveying to her the news of the death
of her husband; but it is more than doubtful whether
this be genuine. He says of it: "It still survives. It
breathes, in the quaint language of the day, a noble
strain of sympathy and homage." It does not exist
except in Mr. Hawker's book, and is almost certainly
a fabrication by him.</p>

   <p class="caption2">ANTONY PAYNE<br />
<i>From the picture by Sir Godfrey Kneller</i></p>
</div>

<p>At the Restoration, Sir John Grenville was created
Earl of Bath, and was made governor of the garrison
of Plymouth, and he then appointed Payne halberdier
of the guns. The King, who held Payne in great
favour, made him a yeoman of his guards, and Sir
Godfrey Kneller, the Court artist, was employed to
paint his portrait.</p>

<p>Whilst in Plymouth garrison an incident occurred
that has been recorded by Hawker. At the mess-table
of the regiment, during the reign of William
and Mary, on the anniversary of the day when
Charles I had been beheaded, a sub-officer of Payne's
own rank had ordered a calf's head to be served
up. This was a coarse and common annual mockery of
the beheaded king indulged in by the remnants of the
old fanatical Puritan party. When Payne entered
the room his comrades pointed out the dish to him.
Anthony flared up, and flung the plate and its
contents out of the window. A quarrel and a
challenge ensued, and at break of day Payne and
his antagonist fought with swords on the ramparts,
and Anthony ran the offender through the swordarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and disabled him, as he shouted, "There's sauce
for thy calf's head."</p>

<p>Hawker, who tells the story, supposed that the incident
occurred during the reign of George I. But
Anthony died at an age little short of eighty, and was
buried at Stratton July 13th, 1691, and William of
Orange did not die till 1702.</p>

<p>After his death at Stratton, which took place in the
house where he was born, neither door nor stairs
would afford egress for the large coffined corpse. The
joists had to be sawn through, and the floor lowered
with rope and pulley, to enable the giant to pass out to
his last resting-place, under the south wall of Stratton
Church.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The history of the vicissitudes through which went
the painting by Kneller is peculiarly interesting.</p>

<p>When Stowe was dismantled, on the death of the
Earl of Bath, the picture was removed to Penheale,
another Cornish residence of the Grenville family.</p>

<p>But here the portrait of him who had done so much
for the house was not valued, and was soon forgotten.
Gilbert, the Cornish historian, in one of his rambles,
whilst staying at an old inn in Launceston, was informed
that this painting was still extant, and he
went to Penheale, where the farmer's wife occupying
the house said that she did indeed possess "a carpet
with the effigy of a large man on it," that had been
given to her husband by the steward on the estate. It
was rolled up, and in a bad and dirty condition. She
gladly sold it to C. S. Gilbert for £8. On Gilbert's
death his effects were sold at Devonport, and a stranger
bought it for £42. In London it was recognized as
the work of Kneller, and was resold for the sum of
£800. It next appeared amongst the effects of the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Admiral Tucker, at Trematon Castle; and when the
sale took place this picture was bought by a gentleman
in Devon. Finally Mr. (now Sir) Robert Harvey purchased
it, and most generously presented it to the
Royal Institution of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The authorities for Anthony Payne are Hawker's
<i>Footprints of Former Men in Cornwall</i>; the <i>Journal
of the R. Inst. of Cornwall</i>, Vol. X, 1890-1; Wood
(E. J.), <i>Giants and Dwarfs</i>, 1868.</p>

<p>Next in size to Anthony Payne among big Cornishmen
was Charles Chilcott, of Tintagel, who measured
6 feet 4 inches high, and round the breast 6 feet
9 inches, and who weighed 460 pounds. He was
almost constantly occupied in smoking, three pounds
of tobacco being his weekly allowance. His pipe was
two inches long. One of his stockings would contain
six gallons of wheat. He was much gratified when
strangers came to visit him, and to them his usual
address was, "Come under my arm, little fellow." He
died in his sixtieth year, 5th April, 1815.</p>

<h2>NEVIL NORTHEY BURNARD</h2>


<p>Was the son of George Burnard, a stonemason,
who lived at Penpont, Altarnon,
in a house with mullioned windows and
a newel staircase, said to have been the
old manor house of Penpont. He was born in 1818,
and was baptized on November 1st in that year.</p>

<p>The only education Nevil received was from his
mother, who kept a dame's school and made straw
bonnets in her spare time.</p>

<p>He was mortar-boy to his father, and would often
slip away and cut figures of men and animals on an old
oak door, getting many a "lacing" for not minding his
proper work. His earliest tools were nails, which he
sharpened on a grinding-stone, before he had any
chisels.</p>

<p>There was at that time no machinery for facing slate
slabs; so he used an old French "burr"&mdash;i.e. part of
a French millstone. Such millstones were constructed
in four parts, cemented together. This "burr" he put
into a rough frame of wood, and used it like a plane
over the face of the slate, which was laid on a bench,
or "horse." The existing examples of slabs worked
in this way are most excellent, in flatness and in
smoothness.</p>

<p>The Delabole slate had been employed for many
centuries for tombstones and monuments, and lent
itself surprisingly to being sculptured. In the North
Cornish churches are numerous examples of monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
richly sculptured with heraldic figures of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, all on slate, and
sharp to this day as when they left the workshop.</p>

   <p class="caption2">NEVIL NORTHEY BURNARD<br />
<i>From a bas-relief by the sculptor himself, in the possession of S. Pearn, Esq.,
Altarnon</i></p>
</div>

<p>At the age of fourteen Nevil cut a tombstone to his
grandfather; that is now in Altarnon churchyard,
and affords evidence of skill, artistic sense, and fineness
of detail. There are other stones of his in the
same churchyard; also one or two by his brother
George. An old man is still alive in Altarnon who
used to sharpen the nails on a grindstone for Burnard,
with which he did his carving on slate.</p>

<p>At fifteen he left Altarnon. Wesley's head, over the
porch of the old Meeting-house, Penpont, was cut by
him when he was sixteen.</p>

<p>From Altarnon he went to Fowey, and the late Sir
Charles Lemon, of Carclew, took him by the hand.
At the age of sixteen he carved in slate the group of
Laocoon, sent in 1834 to the Exhibition of the Royal
Cornwall Polytechnic Society at Falmouth. This
carving in bass-relief, executed by a boy from a wild
moorland village, without instruction, copied from
a wood-cut in the <i>Penny Magazine</i>, and with tools of
his own making, was considered so very remarkable
a production that the Society awarded him a silver
medal. Nevil was sent to London, and through Sir
Charles Lemon's influence was presented to the Queen
and Prince Consort, and he was allowed to cut a profile
of the Prince of Wales, then a boy, and this portrait
was sent to Osborne, and was approved by the Royal
parents. Sir Charles Lemon further introduced the
lad to Chantrey, who secured for him employment as a
carver in one of the most celebrated ateliers in London.</p>

<p>Burnard reproduced his profile of the Prince of
Wales in marble for the Public Hall at Falmouth, and
the general opinion expressed upon it was that it amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
sustained the early expectation which had been formed
of his talents.</p>

<p>Thus fairly launched in his profession as a carver in
London, he found employment in the studios of the
best sculptors of the day, as Bailey, Marshall, and
Foley; and there was no lack of work, and no falling
short of pay.</p>

<p>Caroline Fox, in her <i>Memories of Old Friends</i>, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1847, October 4th.&mdash;Burnard, our Cornish sculptor,
dined with us. He is a great, powerful, pugilistic-looking
fellow at twenty-nine; a great deal of face, with all
the features massed in the centre; mouth open, and all
sorts of simplicities flowing out of it. He liked talking of
himself and his early experiences. His father, a stonemason,
once allowed him to carve the letters on a little
cousin's tombstone which would be hidden in the grass;
this was his first attempt, and instead of digging in the
letters he dug around them, and made each stand out in
relief. His stories of Chantrey very odd: on his death
Lady Chantrey came into the studio with a hammer and
knocked off the noses of many completed busts, so that
they might not be too common&mdash;a singular attention to
her departed lord. Described his own distress when
waiting for Sir Charles Lemon to take him to Court: he
felt very warm, and went into a shop for some ginger-beer;
the woman pointed the bottle at him, and he was
drenched. After wiping himself as well as he could he
went out to dry in the sun. He went first to London
without his parents knowing anything about it, because
he wished to spare them anxiety, and let them know
nothing until he could announce that he was regularly
employed by Mr. Weekes. He showed us his bust of
the Prince of Wales&mdash;a beautiful thing, very intellectual,
with a strong likeness to the Queen&mdash;which he was
exhibiting at the Polytechnic, where it will remain."</p>

<p>"1849, March 1st.&mdash;Found a kindly note from
Thomas Carlyle. He has seen 'my gigantic countryman,'
Burnard, and conceives that there is real faculty
in him; he gave him advice, and says he is the sort of
person whom he will gladly help if he can. Burnard
forwarded to me, in great triumph, the following note
he had received from Carlyle with reference to a projected
bust of Charles Buller: '<i>February</i> 25th, 1849....
Nay, if the conditions <i>never</i> mend, and you cannot get
that Bust to do at all, you may find yet (as often turns
out in life) that it was <i>better</i> for you you did not.
Courage! Persist in your career with wise strength,
with silent resolution, with manful, patient, unconquerable
endeavour; and if there lie a talent in you (as
I think there does), the gods will permit you to develop
it yet.&mdash;Believe me, yours very sincerely, T. Carlyle.'"</p>

<p>On the return of Richard Lander from Africa, after
having traced the Niger through a great part of its
course, Burnard was commissioned to execute a statue
of the explorer for the column erected in Lander's
honour at Truro. His only other public work of any
consequence was the statue of Ebenezer Elliott, the
Corn-law Rhymer, for the market-place of Sheffield;
but he was employed in executing portrait busts of
many men of importance, as General Gough, Professor
John Couch Adams, his fellow-Cornishman, Professor
Ed. Forbes, and one of Makepeace Thackeray,
which Burnard gave as a present to the Cottonian
Library at Plymouth, where it now stands above the
door.</p>

<p>He exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1855, 1858,
1866, and 1867. He married in London, but lost his
wife, and then took to drink. The boys, as he said,
jeered at him, and called him "Old Burnard."</p>

<p>As a man, he was tall and big, with an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
head which no ordinary hat would fit; so that his hats
had to be made for him.</p>

<p>Eventually he went "on tramp," paying periodical
visits to old friends at Altarnon. He would make
sketches, draw portraits, at farms and in public-houses;
was ready to write an article for a newspaper, or to
make an election squib, for either side; and was, in fact,
as clever with his pen and pencil as he was with chisel.</p>

<p>He was a most entertaining companion, and able to
converse on any subject.</p>

<p>Thus he lived by his wits, mixing with the highest,
but by preference with the lowest. The last time he
visited Altarnon was in 1877, three years before his
death; he remained there on that occasion for a week,
with hardly any clothes to his back, and was boarded
by his old playmate, Mr. S. Pearn, and slept in the
common lodging-house, Five-lanes. After having been
fitted out with fresh clothes by some friends he proceeded
to the west of the county.</p>

<p>During this last visit at Altarnon he drew some large
pencil heads, which show a firm and delicate hand, but
he delighted in minute execution. There is also
evidence that his mind at this time was as steady as
his hand, for he composed a poem on the death of Mr.
F. Herring, one or two verses of which may be given.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stood beside the spot where late you laid him,<br /></span>

<p>He was equally ready to lampoon any one, whether
friend or foe; probably accommodating his muse to the
humour of those with whom he happened to be.</p>

<p>One day he had been making a sketch of a farmer
called Nicoll, and resorted to the public-house in Liskeard
with his patron. Whilst there he scribbled on a
piece of paper and handed to his friend Nicoll:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is at Penpont House, Altarnon, a small
profile head of Burnard executed by himself. It
is a cameo in plaster of Paris. He is said to have
sketched his face by looking in a mirror, and then
cut an intaglio in slate from his drawing.</p>

<p>Nevil N. Burnard died in the Union, Redruth, of
heart and kidney complaint, 27th November, 1878.</p>

<h2>SIR GOLDSWORTHY GURNEY, KNT.,
INVENTOR</h2>


<p>This man of remarkable versatility and genius
was the fourth son of John Gurney, of Trevargus;
he was born at Treator, near Padstow,
on February 14th, 1793, and was
baptized at Padstow on the ensuing 26th June.</p>

<p>He was named after his godmother, a daughter of
General Goldsworthy and a maid of honour to Queen
Charlotte. He was educated at the Truro Grammar
School, and during part of his holidays was wont to
stay with a relative, the rector of S. Erth, in which
parish lived Mr. Davies Giddy (who afterwards changed
his name, and was better known as Mr. Davies Gilbert,
President of the Royal Society), in whose house he
very frequently met Richard Trevithick, a plain, unpretending
man, of great genius, connected with the
neighbouring copper mines, who lived near, and who
often consulted Mr. Giddy on mathematical calculations
connected with the steam-engine and his mechanical
inventions. Although so young, Mr. Gurney,
whose natural bent was for these subjects, soon formed
an acquaintance with this singularly original and
talented man, and he continued during the period of
his medical studies in correspondence with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurney saw Trevithick's first steam-carriage in
1804, and followed closely his improvements and experiments
on locomotion, and he remembered, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the contemptuous treatment this gifted man
received at the hands of the engineers of the day.</p>

SIR GOLDSWORTHY GURNEY</p>
</div>

<p>His views were described as "wild theories," and his
plans were scoffed at. But Mr. Giddy or Gilbert
encouraged Trevithick to go on and not be discouraged,
and Richard Trevithick became the inventor of the
locomotive as well as of the high-pressure engine. His
first locomotive was constructed to travel on common
roads; he afterwards modified it and set it to run on
rails at Merthyr Tydvil. The trial was made there on
February 4th, 1804. In the year 1813 he exhibited his
locomotive on a temporary railway, laid for the purpose
near Euston Square, and showed the great speed it was
capable of attaining. This speed, however, was only
maintained while the accumulated steam in the boiler was
worked off, but his experiment showed that, if a sufficient
quantity of steam could be "kept up," as he termed
it, the speed might be maintained for any distance and
any length of time. But how was this to be effected?
That was the difficulty, and that difficulty arose out of
another&mdash;how was a sufficient draught to be created to
keep the fire in the furnace at full activity? As the
locomotive moved it created a draught the reverse of
that required for the fire, and unless a strong and steady
draught into the furnace could be created, sufficient
heat could not be generated to produce a sufficient and
continuous amount of steam.</p>

<p>Trevithick in his first locomotive had discharged the
steam up the funnel to get rid of it, but without any
idea of creating a vacuum by means of which a draught
could be caused. Stephenson did the same. Mr.
Smiles has claimed that the "steam-jet" was invented
by Stephenson, but this was not the case. The steam
used in Trevithick's and Stephenson's engines was
waste or exhaust steam, discharging itself through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
funnel indeed, but not filling it, so that it created no
perceptible draught.</p>

<p>Mr. Smiles says: "The steam after performing
its duty in the cylinders was at first allowed to escape
into the open atmosphere with a hissing blast, to the
terror of horses and cattle. It was complained of as
a nuisance, and a neighbouring squire threatened to
commence an action against the colliery lessees unless
it was put a stop to."</p>

<p>Accordingly the steam was introduced into the funnel
about half-way up at the side so as to get rid of it and
obviate the objection of the noise. But the evidence
that Stephenson had discovered that it could be employed
to create a draught is inconclusive.</p>

<p>Goldsworthy Gurney had been placed at Wadebridge
with Dr. Avery as a medical pupil, and there he
married Elizabeth Symons in 1814. He settled down
at Wadebridge as a surgeon, but his active mind would
not let him rest as a small country practitioner; he felt
that he had powers and visions that would bring him
before the public as an inventor and a benefactor.
Accordingly he moved to London in 1820, where he
made the acquaintance of several able physicians, and
was called to deliver a course of lectures on the elements
of chemical science at the Surrey Institute. It was in
1823 that he began his experiments with steam and on
locomotion, and he abandoned the medical profession
in order to devote himself to these researches. His
desire was to construct an engine that would travel
on common roads, and travel at a more rapid pace than
horses.</p>

<p>Now Stephenson, in his evidence before a Parliamentary
Committee, stated that the rate at which his
locomotive travelled was "from 3 to 5 or 6 miles
an hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> So that these hypothetical cases of 12 miles an
hour do not fall within your general experience?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> They do not.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> Laying aside the 12 miles an hour, I think the
rate at which these experiments were made was about
6&frac34; miles to 7?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> I think the average was 6&frac12; miles."</p>

<p>In the first edition of Nicholas Wood's <i>Treatise on
Railways</i>, 1829, occurs this passage: "It is far from
my wish to promulgate to the world that the ridiculous
expectations, or rather professions, of the enthusiastic
specialist, will be realized, and that we shall see them
travelling at the rate of 12, 16, 18, or 20 miles an hour.
Nothing could do more harm towards their adoption or
general improvement than the promulgation of such
nonsense."</p>

<p>Before a second edition appeared, Mr. Gurney's
steam-jet had revolutionized the engine, and it blew
this absurd passage out of the book and the disbelief
out of Wood's head.</p>

<p>Nicholas Wood was a viewer at Killingworth Colliery,
and assisted George Stephenson in his experiments, and
he first saw the steam-blast in Mr. Hackworth's <i>Sans
Pareil</i> in 1829, so that gentleman had adopted it on Mr.
Gurney's recommendation and according to his plan.</p>

<p>Wood thus describes what he then saw: "Mr.
Hackworth had, it appears, in his engine, resorted to
the use of the waste steam in a more forcible manner
than before used, throwing it up in a jet, and which,
when the engine moved at a rapid rate, and the steam
thereby almost constantly issued from the pipe, had a
most powerful effect. The consequence was, that when
the engine began to travel at the rate of twelve or
fifteen miles an hour, the draught was so great that it
actually threw the coke out of the chimney."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then is the first sight of the steam-blast to
Nicholas Wood, fellow-worker with George Stephenson.
He knew nothing of it before.</p>

<p>But Goldsworthy Gurney's steam-blast had been
adopted before this on steamboats. It was first applied
to the <i>Alligator</i> in 1824; then to the <i>Duchess of
Clarence</i>, and other steamboats. It had made its way
into France.</p>

<p>In the Lords' Committee Report of 1849 on "Accidents
in Mines," a Mr. Keene, engineer of Bayonne,
was examined.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> Have you ever seen Mr. Gurney's plan used on
the Continent?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> It has been used on the Continent for producing
draughts in furnace-chimneys.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> Furnace-chimneys&mdash;for what purpose?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> Where the draught has been sluggish; I used it
to get a stronger draught on board a steamboat in 1830, to
enable me to stem the strong currents of the Garonne.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> Have you any knowledge of some experiments
made by Mr. Gurney in the year 1826 with respect to
the power of the steam-jet?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> I saw frequent experiments made by Mr. Gurney
in 1826 to produce draught by the action of high-pressure
steam, exactly in the same way as it is now employed
for producing ventilation in the collieries; that is,
there were a number of jets of about a quarter to three-eighths
of an inch diameter, communicating directly
with a high-pressure boiler; the cock being open, the
full steam from the boiler was brought upon those jets,
and a draught was produced by their action in the
chimney-shaft.</p>

<p>"<i>Q.</i> In the chimney-shaft of a locomotive engine?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> In the chimney-shaft of a locomotive and in the
shaft of a factory; the experiments were tried in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
ways. I saw these experiments frequently; many
other persons saw them at the same time; and I employed
the same myself shortly afterwards for a like
purpose abroad."</p>

<p>Mr. Keene in his evidence further stated, in answer
to the question whether Mr. Gurney's experiments
were open to the public:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many persons visited the place daily, and the
carriage went out into the road, and into the barracks,
and was often surrounded by a group of persons. It
was understood and known how this draught was
procured, because the passage of the steam was heard
up the chimney when the carriage was still, and the
great draught of the furnace was the occasion of
remark by everybody who was around it; they were
quite surprised how such a great current could be
produced with so small a height of chimney: it was
a very remarkable thing, and drew attention from
everybody around at that time."</p>

<p>The principle of the action of the steam-blast was
simple enough. It was to fill the funnel with high-pressure
steam, which would act much as the sucker
in a pump, exhaust the air and draw up air through
the furnace, as the cone of steam escaped out of the
funnel. To act thus, the steam must completely fill
the chimney, allowing of no down draught.</p>

<p>This was what had entirely escaped Trevithick and
Stephenson. Up to the discovery of the steam-jet by
Gurney, the waste steam, as has been stated, was uselessly
dispersed through the chimney.</p>

<p>In 1827, Gurney took a steam-carriage he had constructed
to Cyfarthfa, at the request of Mr. Crawshay,
and while there applied his steam-jet to the blast-furnaces.
This gave a great impetus to the manufacture
of iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephenson now adopted it, and employed it for his
locomotive the <i>Rocket</i>, that ran on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway in October, 1829. Previously on
one occasion Stephenson had run his engine continuously
for fifty-three minutes doing twelve miles. But
now, with the adoption of the steam-blast, it attained
a velocity of twenty-nine miles an hour.</p>

<p>"It is not too much to say that the success of the
locomotive depended upon the adoption of the steam-blast.
Without that, by which the intensity of combustion,
and the consequent evolution of steam, were
maintained at the highest point, high rates of speed
could not have been kept up, the advantages of the
multitubular boiler afterwards invented could never
have been fairly tested, and locomotives might still
have been dragging themselves unwieldily along at
little more than five or six miles an hour."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It had been in July of the same year that Gurney had
made a journey in his steam-coach from London to
Bath and back again, on the main road, at the rate
of fifteen miles an hour. This journey, undertaken at
the request of the quartermaster-general of the army,
was the first long journey at a maintained speed ever
made by any locomotive on road or rail.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurney's steam-coach was, of course, provided
with the steam-jet.</p>

<p>The <i>Mirror</i> of December 15th, 1827, says: "Mr.
Goldsworthy Gurney, whose name is familiar to most
of our readers, after a variety of experiments during
the last two years, has completed a steam-carriage on
a new principle. We have accordingly introduced the
annexed engraving, which will enable our readers to
enter into the details of the machinery. First as to its
safety, upon which point the public are most sceptical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
In the present invention it is stated that even from the
bursting of the boiler there is not the most distant
chance of mischief to the passengers. The boiler is
tubular, and upon a plan totally distinct from anything
previously in use.... The weight of the carriage
and its apparatus is estimated at 1&frac12; tons, and its wear
and tear of the road, as compared with a carriage
drawn by four horses, is as one to six. When the
carriage is in progress the machinery is not heard.
The engine has a 12-horse power, but may be increased
to 16; while the actual horse-power in use, except in
ascending a hill, is but eight horses.... Mr.
Gurney has already secured a patent for his invention;
but he has our best wishes for permanent
success."</p>

<p>Sir Charles Dance in 1831 ran a steam-coach of
Gurney's make between Gloucester and Cheltenham
five times a day for four months, and during this time
carried three thousand passengers some four thousand
miles, without a single accident occurring.</p>

<p>There seemed to be every prospect of the steam-carriage
superseding the mail-coach, and indeed of
private gentlemen setting up their Gurney steam-carriages,
as now they run their motors. But trustees
of roads, coach-proprietors, coachmen, and other interested
persons formed a strong body of opposition.
How violent this was may be judged from the fact that
on one occasion a pile of stones eighteen inches high
was thrown across the road, and in struggling through
it the axle of the coach was broken.</p>

<p>But prejudice and dullness are mighty powers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>Parliament interfered. Tolls on highways were
raised to a prohibitive rate, so that the running of steam-conveyances
was brought to a standstill. A committee
of the House of Commons, appointed in 1831 to inquire
into the matter, reported "that the steam-carriage was
one of the most important improvements in the means
of internal communication ever introduced; that its
practicability had been fully established; and that the
prohibitory clauses against its use ought to be immediately
repealed." The committee recommended that
the Turnpike Act should be repealed. It ascertained
that upon the Liverpool and Prescot road Mr. Gurney
would be charged £2 8s., while a loaded stage-coach
would have to pay 4s. On the Bath road the
same carriage would be charged £1 7s. 1d., while a
coach drawn by four horses would pay 5s. On the
Ashburton and Totnes road Mr. Gurney would have
to pay £2, while a coach drawn by four horses would be
charged only 3s. On the Teignmouth and Dawlish
road the proportion was 12s. to 2s.</p>

<p>The Report of the Committee on Steam-Carriages,
ordered to be printed by the House of Commons,
12th October, 1831, was reasonable and just. It reported:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Besides the carriages already mentioned, 'twenty
or forty others are being built by different persons, all
of which have been occasioned by his (Mr. Gurney's)
decided journey in 1829.'</p>

<p>"The committee have great pleasure in drawing the
attention of the House to the evidence of Mr. Farey.
He states that he has no doubt whatever but that a
steady perseverance in such trials will lead to the
general adoption of steam-carriages; and again, that
what has been done proves the practicability of impelling
stage-coaches by steam on good common roads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
without horses, at a speed of eight or ten miles an
hour.</p>

<p>"Much, of course, must remain to be done in improving
their efficacy; yet Mr. Gurney states that he
has kept up steadily the rate of twelve miles per hour;
that the extreme rate at which he has run is between
twenty and thirty miles per hour.</p>

<p>"The several witnesses have estimated the probable
saving of expense to the public, from the substitution
of steam power for that of horses, at from one-half to
two-thirds. Mr. Farey gives, as his opinion, that
steam-coaches will very soon after their establishment
be run for one-third of the cost of the present stage-coaches.</p>

<p>"Sufficient evidence has been adduced to convince
your committee&mdash;</p>

<p>"That carriages can be propelled by steam on
common roads at an average rate of ten miles per
hour.</p>

<p>"That they can ascend and descend hills of considerable
inclination with facility and safety.</p>

<p>"That they are perfectly safe for passengers.</p>

<p>"That they are not nuisances to the public.</p>

<p>"That they will become a speedier and cheaper
mode of conveyance than carriages drawn by horses.</p>

<p>"That such carriages will cause less wear of roads
than coaches drawn by horses.</p>

<p>"That rates of toll have been imposed on steam-carriages,
which would prohibit their being used on
several lines of road, were such charges permitted to
remain unaltered."</p>

<p>But the House of Commons would not listen to the
recommendations of its committee, and the employment
of motors as means of locomotion on roads was
postponed till the present age, when again dullness did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
its best to impede the adoption and to drive the manufacture
out of England to France.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney was in advance of his time,
and had to suffer accordingly. The committee had
suggested that as the prohibition of steam-coaches on
roads was a ruinous blow to Gurney, he should be
indemnified with a grant of £16,000. But the Chancellor
of the Exchequer refused the grant, and the Bill,
after passing the Commons, was thrown out by the
Lords.</p>

<p>So the unfortunate Goldsworthy Gurney, after having
abandoned his profession, in which he was rapidly
gaining a large practice, and after spending £30,000
and five years of toil to perfect his invention, was ruined.</p>

<p>Another of his inventions was the Bude light, at
first intended for lighthouses. For this he obtained
a patent in 1838. In its first form it consisted of a
common Argand oil lamp of rather narrow circular
bore and the introduction into the centre of the flame
of a jet of oxygen. This was not, however, an original
discovery, for it had been employed by Dr. Ure in
Glasgow in 1806 or 1807. But it was found to be too
expensive for use in lighthouses, nor was the brilliancy
of the flame sufficiently heightened to lead the Masters
of Trinity House to adopt it.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurney was not discouraged. It had long been
known that by dissecting a flame of the compound jet
of hydrogen and oxygen upon a bit of clay a most
vivid illumination was set forth. But Mr. Gurney substituted
lime for clay as less liable to disintegration by
heat; and he adopted the Argand lamp with an improvement
such as had been suggested and adopted from
Fresnel. This consisted in a lamp composed of a
series of four, five, or six concentric wicks on the same
plane, supplied with oil from a fountain below by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
means of a pump; and he obtained a second patent in
1839. He next applied his principle to gas, purified
in a peculiar manner, and burned in compound Argand
lamps, consisting of two or more concentric rings perforated
with rows of holes in their upper surfaces,
having intervals between the rings for the admission
of an upward rush of air to maintain a high incandescence.
The intensity and whiteness of the light thus
produced by the combustion of coal-gas surpassed
anything hitherto discovered till the production of the
mantle-burner.</p>

<p>It was he, moreover, who proposed the flash-light for
lighthouses, as a means by which seamen might
identify lighthouses. He proposed that a powerful
light should be made by periodic flashes to correspond
with the number of the lighthouse, and that every
lighthouse along the coast should have a registered
number, so that the number of flashes per minute
should represent the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Gurney was present at Sir W. Snow Harris's experiment
on Somerset House terrace with wire for
ships' lightning-conductors. Turning to Sir Anthony
Carlisle, in reference to the magnetic needle which, as
he observed, made starts on meeting the poles of a
galvanic battery, he said with the inspiration of genius,
"Here is an element which may, and I foresee will,
be made the means of intelligible communication."</p>

<p>Whilst engaged at the Surrey Institution he invented
the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe. Before this was
introduced the risk of accident was so great that recourse
was seldom had to oxyhydrogen.</p>

<p>Gurney applied his steam-jet to other purposes than
propelling locomotives and exciting the ardour of
furnaces in ironworks. By its means he extinguished
the fire of a burning coal-mine at Astley, in Lancashire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and in 1849 another at Clackmannan, where the
bed of coal had been burning for over thirty years. He
also employed it for expelling noxious gases from sewers,
and planned and superintended in 1849 the ventilation
by this means of the pestilential sewer in Friar
Street, London, which resisted all other efforts to cleanse
it; and he suggested to the metropolitan commissioner
of sewers that a steam-jet apparatus should be placed
at the mouth of every sewer emptying into the great
main sewer by the Thames river-side.</p>

<p>He was employed on the lighting, heating, and
ventilation of the old House of Commons, and he held
the appointment of superintendent of these functions
from 1854 to 1863.</p>

<p>He had remarked that the flame of hydrogen gas
caused vibrations that produced musical tones, and
in 1823 wrote on "the analogy between chemical
and musical combinations." He suggested "an improved
finger-keyed musical instrument, in the use of
which a performer is enabled to hold or prolong the
notes, and to increase or modify the tone at pleasure."
In 1825 and 1833 he proposed "certain improvements
in musical instruments." He invented a stove, and
saw and advocated the advantage of the employment
of circulation of hot water for the heating of a building.
He advocated the employment of concrete for foundations
where there was no rock, and to show that it was
possible to build a house upon the sand, he reared the
castle at Bude upon concrete floated into the shifting
sand above high-water mark. He again was the first to
point out and insist on the necessity for there being
two shafts to every colliery, so as to maintain a circulation
of air.</p>

<p>For several years Mr. Gurney resided at Hanacott
Manor, near Launceston, but he had also a house at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Reeds, in Poughill by Bude, and the castle at the latter
place, which is usually let. He was knighted in 1863&mdash;a
tardy acknowledgment of his great services and
extraordinary ability. The honour came too late to
really advantage him. That same year he was stricken
with paralysis, and therefore could do nothing in the
way of scientific research and invention. He was
attended till his death by his only child, a daughter,
Miss Anna D. Gurney. He expired at Reeds on the
28th February, 1875, and was buried at Launcells in
the graveyard just under the south wall of the nave.</p>

<p>Like Henry Trengrouse, so with Sir Goldsworthy
Gurney&mdash;a man of genius and perseverance, and one
who benefited mankind, received no adequate recognition
in his lifetime. May posterity do for him, as
for Trengrouse, what his contemporaries denied him.
Mr. Smiles vainly endeavoured to refuse to credit him
with the invention of the steam-blast; but the writer
of his life in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
afforded him tardy justice. "One soweth and another
reapeth" is true of all inventors with few exceptions.
How much do we owe to Sir Goldsworthy! He was the
pioneer of locomotion by motors on our roads, the salvation
of many lives by the ventilation of coal-mines;
he invented the system of heating mansions by hot
water, the flash-light for lighthouses, the steam-blast
revolutionizing locomotion by steam; he showed that
houses could be built on concrete foundations; he discovered
the limelight, the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe:
and he was repaid with a barren knighthood when
about to be struck down by paralysis.</p>

<h2>THE JANES</h2>


<p>The family of Jane, descended from the ancient
family of Janes of Worcestershire, was settled
in Cornwall at an early date. It bore as its
arms, arg. a lion rampant az. between 3 escallops
gules. It was settled in S. Winnow early in the sixteenth
century, and at the beginning of the following
century was at Lanhydrock and at Liskeard, at which
latter place Thomas Jane was mayor in 1621. His son
Joseph Jane was M.P. for Liskeard in 1625 and 1640,
and was mayor in 1631, 1635, and 1636. He married
Loveday, daughter of William Kekewich, in 1633. He
was a whole-hearted Royalist, and when the King was at
Oxford, in 1643, he attended him there. In the following
year he was one of the Royal Commissioners in
Cornwall, and when Charles I came to Cornwall, in
1644, he entertained him in August in his house at
Liskeard.</p>

<p>During 1645 and 1646 he carried on a correspondence
with Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, on
the condition of the Royalist cause in Cornwall.
Liskeard had fallen into the hands of the Parliamentarians,
but Sir Ralph Hopton defeated Ruthven on
Braddock Down on January 19th, 1643, and recovered
Liskeard for the King. Ruthven fled to Saltash,
which he fortified with much expedition.</p>

<p>When the Royal cause was lost the vengeance of
the Parliament fell on Joseph Jane, and he was nearly
ruined by the heavy composition he was forced to pay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
In 1650, and again in 1654, he was named Clerk of
the Royal Council, but it was an empty honour;
Charles II could pay nothing, and the Council could
only grumble and plot.</p>

<p>Jane attempted to answer Milton's Εικονοκλαστης in a
work, Εικων ακλαστος the Unbroken Image, but it was a
poor performance. It was published in 1651; Hyde
says, however, in a letter to Secretary Nicholas, "the
King hath a singular good esteem both of Joseph Jane
and of his book."</p>

<p>He had a son, William Jane, baptized at Liskeard,
22nd October, 1645, who was educated at Westminster
School, elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, 1660,
and graduated B.A. in 1664, and M.A. in 1667, and D.D.
in 1674. After his ordination he was appointed lecturer
at Carfax. He attracted the attention of Henry Compton,
who became Canon of Christ Church in 1669, by
his sturdy loyalty and orthodoxy; and when Compton
became Bishop of Oxford, he chose Jane to preach the
sermon at his consecration, and he appointed him one
of his chaplains.</p>

<p>In 1670 he became Canon of Christ Church, and was
given the living of Winnington in Essex. In 1679 he
received a prebendal stall in S. Paul's Cathedral and
the archdeaconry of Middlesex. In May, 1680, he
was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford.
This rapid promotion was due in part to the staunch
loyalty of his father and the losses of his family on
that account, but also to his cool, businesslike abilities,
and to his learning, which though not profound was
good.</p>

<p>In July, 1683, he framed the Oxford declaration in
favour of Passive Obedience, and committed the University
to an opinion which subsequent events were
calculated to stultify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>As Green says: "The Cavaliers who had shouted
for the King's return, had shouted also for the return
of a free Parliament. The very Chief Justice who
asserted at the trial of the Regicides, the general freedom
of the King from any responsibility to the Nation,
asserted just as strongly that doctrine of ministerial
responsibility, against which Charles the First had
struggled. It was the desire of every royalist to blot
out the very memory of the troubles in which monarchy
and freedom had alike disappeared, to take up again,
as if it had never been broken, the thread of our
political history. But the point at which even royalists
took it up was not at the moment of the Tyranny, but
at the moment of the Long Parliament's first triumph,
when that Tyranny had been utterly undone. In his
wish to revive this older claim of the Crown, which the
Long Parliament had for ever set aside, the young
King found himself alone. His closest adherents, his
warmest friends, were constitutional royalists of the
temper of Falkland and Culpepper. Partisans of an
absolute monarchy, of such a monarchy as his grandfather
had dreamed of and his father had for a few years
carried into practice, there now were none."</p>

<p>The clergy in advocating passive obedience were
actuated by the sense of the miseries through which
England had passed during the Great Rebellion&mdash;better
to submit under protest than to fly to arms
again, better certainly to submit even to what was
deemed an injustice or inexpedient, when the Crown
was hedged about with restrictions, and when the
ministers of the Crown were responsible to the nation.
There was, however, a noisy and vehement party that
went much beyond this, and one Filmer had worked
the theory of Divine Right of the Sovereign into a
system, that was accepted by the more crazy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
immoderate of the old Tory party, mainly among the
clergy; and the Oxford declaration went a long way in
this direction. Men were beating about for a theory
on which to base Government by a King, they had not
grasped the truth that the King represents the people,
just as does a President in a Republic, but with the
superaddition of Divine ratification and imparted grace
for the task of ruling, by unction and coronation. That
the Kings of England had ever been elected, and that
coronation was the confirmation by God, through the
Church, of the choice of the people, had been forgotten
through the prevalence of feudal ideas in the Middle
Ages. Filmer propounded his doctrine that the Divine
Right rested in primogeniture, and the rabid Tories,
looking out for a theory, snatched at this for want of
a better.</p>

<p>On the very day on which Russell was put to death,
the University of Oxford adopted by a solemn public
act, drawn up by Jane, this strange doctrine, and
ordered the political works of Buchanan, Milton, and
Baxter to be publicly burned in the court of the
schools.</p>

<p>James II, in hopes of winning the Earl of Rochester
to join the Papal Church, desired a disputation
between some Roman divines and some of the Church
of England, making no doubt that the former would
be able to confound the latter. The King bade
Rochester to choose English divines, excluding two
only, Tillotson and Stillingfleet, dreading the latter
as a consummate master of all controversial weapons.
Rochester selected Simon Patrick and Jane. The
conference took place at Whitehall on November 13th,
1686, but no auditor was suffered to be present save
the King.</p>

<p>"The subject discussed," says Macaulay, "was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Real Presence. The Roman Catholic divines took on
themselves the burden of the proof. Patrick and Jane
said little, nor was it necessary that they should say
much; for the Earl himself undertook to defend the
doctrine of his Church, and, as was his habit, soon
warmed with the conflict, lost his temper, and asked
with great vehemence whether it was expected that he
should change his religion on such frivolous grounds."</p>

<p>In 1685 Jane had been appointed to the deanery of
Gloucester. He resigned the archdeaconry of Middlesex
in 1686, but retained the canonries of Christ
Church and S. Paul's till his death.</p>

<p>In 1688 James II had fled the kingdom, and the
English nation and Parliament had accepted William
and Mary as King and Queen of England.</p>

<p>The whole fabric of Divine Right had crumbled to
the ground. James had reduced the theory to a <i>reductio
ad impossibile</i>. This even the lay cavaliers had recognized.
"A man convinced against his will is of
the same opinion still," and it was so with the more
fanatical Tories among the clergy. They refused to
take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, and
were thrust out of their cathedral thrones and stalls
and livings, and joined the sect of the Nonjurors.</p>

<p>But Jane was not one of them. He had the good
sense to acknowledge that the theory he had taken up
with some ardour was as impracticable as it was
absurd. It was cast in his teeth that he changed
his opinion because he desired to retain his benefices.
One need not take this view of his conduct. He
sought William of Orange at Hungerford, and
assured him of the adhesion of the University of
Oxford. His enemies said that he hinted at the same
time his readiness to accept the vacant bishopric in
return for his services in securing this sign of devotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
But nothing is more easy than to make such an
accusation, and there is no proof that he did this.
However, the fact that the framer of the Oxford
declaration should have thrown over the principles
advocated therein, laid him open to attack, and a
shower of epigrams fell on him. His name Jane
gave good opportunity to the wits to liken him to
Janus, who looked two ways at once. But he showed
no further desire to court the favour of William, and
he opposed the projects for Comprehension favoured by
the latitudinarians, Tillotson and Burnet. In 1689 two
Bills had been introduced into Parliament, a Toleration
and a Comprehension Bill. The former was to grant
facilities of worship to the Puritans and other
Dissenters; the other was a Bill for altering the creed
and the formulas and ceremonies of the Church, removing
from them whatever might be distasteful to
the Dissenters, so that all excuse might be taken from
them for separating themselves from the Church. Both
the King and Tillotson, who all knew was destined by
the King to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury, were eager to get both passed.
Tillotson was so latitudinarian that his churchmanship
was nebulous. Burnet was the son of a
Covenanter who had been hanged, had been brought
up in Presbyterianism, had found satisfaction in the
ministry of Calvanist pastors in Holland, and had not
the faintest conception of the principles of the Church
or of its true organization.</p>

<p>The Earl of Nottingham advocated the Comprehension
Bill and drafted both. The Toleration Bill
passed both Houses with little debate. But it was
otherwise with the Comprehension Bill. The first
clause in this dispensed all the ministers in the Church
from the necessity of subscribing the Thirty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Articles. Then it was provided that any minister who
had been ordained after the Presbyterian fashion might
be eligible to any benefice in the Church without
ordination by the bishop.</p>

<p>Then followed clauses providing that a clergyman
might wear the surplice or not as he thought fit; it left
the sign of the cross optional in baptism; and provided
that the Eucharist need not be received kneeling. The
concluding clause was drawn in the form of a petition;
it was proposed that the two Houses should request the
King and the Queen to issue a commission empowering
thirty divines of the Church of England to revise
the liturgy, the canons, and the constitution of the
ecclesiastical courts, and to recommend such alterations
as might seem to them desirable.</p>

<p>But this Bill roused serious opposition. It was felt
by all who had any respect and feeling for the Church,
as one in all times from the Apostolic period, who
regarded her claim to maintain the same faith, the
same Apostolic constitution and the same sacraments,
as from the earliest age of the Church, that this Comprehension
Bill if it became law must of necessity
alienate them from such a body&mdash;drenched with Protestantism,
till scarcely a tinge of the old wine of Catholicism
remained in her; and would leave them no other
course open than to shake off the dust of their feet
against her and join the Church of Rome, or the
Church of the Nonjurors. Most of the bishops who had
taken the oaths to William and Mary were placed on
the Commission; and with them were joined twenty
priests of note. Of these twenty, Tillotson was the
most important as expressing the mind and wishes of
the King. He was a latitudinarian, without a spark of
feeling for historic Christianity. With him went
Stillingfleet, Dean of S. Paul's, Sharp, Dean of Norwich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, Tenison, Rector
of S. Martin's, and Fowler. But conspicuous on the
other side were Aldrich, Dean of Christ Church, and
Jane, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford.</p>

<p>Early in October, 1689, the commissioners assembled
in the Jerusalem Chamber. But hardly had they met
before Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, started up and
denied that the Commission was legal. There was a
sharp altercation, violent words were flung about, and
Sprat, Jane, and Aldrich withdrew. The strength of
the Catholic party was broken, and the rest agreed to
sanction nearly all the changes advocated by those who
desired to entirely alter the character of the Church.</p>

<p>"They had before them," Burnet tells us, "all the
exceptions that either the Puritans before the war, or
the Nonconformists since the Restoration, had made to
any part of the Church service; they had also many
propositions and advices that had been offered, at
several times, by many of our bishops and divines
upon those heads; matters were well considered and
freely and calmly debated; and all digested into an
entire correction of everything that seemed liable to
any just objection." To guide them, as Burnet admits
in his Triennial Visitation Charge of 1704, they were
furnished with a great collection of the books and
papers in which the Dissenters had at different times
set forth their demands. The Commission was prepared
to surrender everything. The chanting of
psalms, even in cathedrals, was to be done away with.
The lessons from the Apocrypha were to be abolished.
The Saints' days omitted from the Calendar, the form
of absolution altered, remission of sins to be removed
from it "as not very intelligible." The cross in baptism,
the use of god-parents, the wearing of the
surplice were to be optional. Episcopal ordination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
was not to be required of the Ministry. Kneeling to
receive the Holy Communion was left to the choice of
the Communicant; the collects, as too concise, were to
be blown out with pious bombast.</p>

<p>It is possible that, as Calamy asserts, such alterations
as these would have brought over two-thirds
of the English Dissenters to the Established Church;
but it is certain that it would have driven two-thirds
of the members of the Church, lay and clerical, out of
her, as having forfeited her claim to be a branch of the
Catholic Church, and they would probably have swelled
the ranks of the Nonjurors, and made of that communion
a body that would have really represented the
Church in England.</p>

<p>Owing to the secession of the Nonjurors, sees and
benefices had been filled with men who were in sympathy
with the views of Tillotson and Burnet, or who
were only solicitous to live in the smiles of William.
Little resistance, if any, was to be expected from the
episcopal bench.</p>

<p>When the Commission had concluded its labours,
writs were issued summoning the Convocation of the
Province of Canterbury. The clergy were in a ferment
throughout England. They thought that the heritage
of faith was going to be taken from them. The Toleration
Act had removed the disabilities of the Dissenters;
they might build their conventicles and preach what
and when they liked; why, then, open the doors of
the Church to admit them as a flood to swamp the
faithful?</p>

<p>When the Declaration of Toleration had been issued
by James II, in 1687, removing all disabilities from the
Dissenters, on the sole understanding that they should
abstain from attacking the Churches of Rome and
England, their preachers found that they had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to say. They preferred to be under disabilities rather
than give up assaults on the Scarlet Woman, Babylon,
the Beast, and Prelacy, its shadow.</p>

<p>When Convocation was elected, it became evident to
all that the bulk of the priests were against all watering
down of the formulas of the Church, her faith, her
ritual. The most important office in Convocation was
that of Prolocutor of the Lower House. The Prolocutor
was to be chosen by the members; Tillotson
was proposed by the Protestant party as one whom the
King delighted to honour, and who it was well known
would be appointed to the Archbishopric of Canterbury
when vacant.</p>

<p>On November 20th, Convocation met in Henry VII's
Chapel at Westminster. "Compton was in the chair.
On the right and left those suffragans of Canterbury
who had taken the oath were ranged in gorgeous vestments
of scarlet and miniver. Below the table was
assembled the crowd of presbyters. Beveridge preached
a Latin sermon, in which he warmly eulogized the existing
system, and yet declared himself favourable to a
moderate reform." In a word, he blew hot and cold
with the same breath.</p>

<p>The Lower House listened, unstirred, cold and resolute.
Dean Shays, put forward by the members
favourable to Comprehension, proposed Tillotson;
Jane was proposed on the other side. After an
animated discussion, Jane was elected by fifty-five
votes to twenty-eight.</p>

<p>The Prolocutor was then formally presented to the
Bishop of London, and made, according to ancient
usage, a Latin oration, in which he eulogized the
Church in England as maintaining the faith as delivered
to the saints, and as preserving all the marks of
the Catholic Church throughout all ages and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
world; and he very plainly declared that no alteration
in a downward direction would be tolerated; and he
concluded with the significant and well-known words,
"Nolumus leges Angliæ mutari."</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the Lower House was
absolutely determined not to have the proposed alterations
made; but the plan they adopted was to shun the
discussion of the recommendations made by the Commissioners,
so as not directly to reject what they knew
lay very near to the King's heart. With this object
they adopted a system of tactics that in the end answered
their purpose.</p>

<p>"The law," says Macaulay, "as it had been interpreted
during a long course of years, prohibited Convocation
from even deliberating on any ecclesiastical
ordinance without a previous warrant from the Crown.
Such a warrant, sealed with the Great Seal, was
brought in form to Henry the Seventh's Chapel by
Nottingham. He at the same time delivered a message
from the King. His Majesty exhorted the assembly
to consider calmly and without prejudice the recommendations
of the Commission, and declared that
he had nothing in view but the honour and advantage
of the Protestant religion in general and of the Church
of England in particular.</p>

<p>"The bishops speedily agreed on an address of thanks
for the royal message, and requested the concurrence of
the Lower House. Jane and his adherents raised
objection after objection. First they claimed the privilege
of presenting a separate address. When they were
forced to waive this claim, they refused to agree to any
expressions which implied that the Church of England
had any fellowship with any other Protestant community.
Amendments and reasons were sent backward and
forward. Conferences were held at which Burnet on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
one side and Jane on the other were the chief speakers.
At last, with great difficulty, a compromise was
made; and an address, cold and ungracious compared
with that which the bishops had framed, was presented
to the King in the Banqueting House. He dissembled
his vexation, returned a kind answer, and intimated a
hope that the assembly would now at length proceed to
consider the great question of Comprehension." But
this was precisely what they were resolute not to consider.
They had made up their minds on the subject
already, but they were unwilling to fly too openly in
the face of the King. As for trusting the bishops to
stand firm on any principle, the Lower House knew
that this was not to be expected. When had the
bishops of the Established Church, since the Reformation,
ever shown firmness and united action on any
principle, except once, and that was to oppose general
Toleration?</p>

<p>So soon as the clergy were again assembled, a
fresh difficulty was started. It was mooted that
the Nonjuring bishops had not been summoned,
and they were to be regarded as bishops of the
Catholic Church quite as certainly as were those
nominees of the King who had been intruded into
their vacated thrones.</p>

<p>Then it was complained that scurrilous pamphlets
were hawked about the streets, and the people were
being worked into a temper of opposition to Convocation.
It was asked why Convocation should be called
together to emasculate the Church, if it was to be
suffered to be jeered at by pamphleteers.</p>

<p>Thus passed week after week. Christmas drew nigh.
The bishops proposed, during the recess, to have a
committee to sit and prepare business. The Lower
House rejected the proposal; and it became plain to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
one that it was determined not to consider one of the
suggested concessions to Protestant prejudice.</p>

<p>Moreover, it soon became evident that the Dissenters
themselves did not desire Comprehension. Their ministers
were petted and made much of by the well-to-do
yeomen and the rich merchants in country and town.
They lived on the fat of the land, snapped up wealthy
widows and bought broad acres. Whereas the needy
country parson was hard pressed to wring the tithes from
his parishioners. While the walls of exclusion of Jericho
stood, the rams' horns brayed against them daily, and
seven times on the Sabbath; but so soon as the walls
were prostrate, and every man could go up into the
city and take up his quarters there where he liked, the
rams' horns would have to be laid aside as superfluous
lumber.</p>

<p>The King was disappointed and offended. What he
did was to prorogue Convocation for six weeks, and
when those six weeks had expired, to prorogue it again,
and many years elapsed before it was again suffered
to assemble.</p>

<p>That Convocation of 1689 saved the Church of
England from dissolution into a formless, gelatinous,
and invertebrate mass.</p>

<p>Burnet himself, though disappointed at the time, felt
afterwards that the determination of the Lower House
had saved the Church at a time of crisis. "There was,"
he says, "a very happy direction of the providence of
God observed in this matter. The Jacobite clergy who
were then under suspension were designing to make a
schism in the Church, whensoever they should be turned
out and their places should be filled up by others.
They saw it would not be easy to make a separation
upon a private and personal account; they therefore
wished to be furnished with more specious pretences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
if we had made alterations in the Rubrics and other parts
of the Common Prayer, they would have pretended that
they still stuck to the ancient Church of England, in
opposition to those who were altering it and setting up
new models. And, as I do firmly believe that there is a
wise providence that watches upon human affairs, and
directs them&mdash;so I have observed this in many instances
relating to the Revolution ... by all the judgments we
could afterwards make, if we had carried a majority in
the Convocation for alterations, they would have done us
more hurt than good."</p>

<p>Burnet was morally and intellectually incapable of
seeing that it was a case of conscience, of <i>stantis vel
cadentis ecclesiæ</i>, and he attributed the motives of the
recalcitrant clergy to political prejudice.</p>

<p>On Jane's return to Oxford, he found another opportunity
of defending the Church, by framing the decree
of 1690, which condemned the "Naked Gospel" of
Arthur Burge.</p>

<p>Jane had no hopes whatever of preferment from
William, if he cared for it. In 1696 it was even
rumoured that the King meditated turning him out of
his professorship, because he had not signed the "Association
for King William." But on Anne's accession,
all his fears were at an end. It would appear from a
letter of Atterbury that at Oxford the University desired
to get rid of him, because he neglected giving lectures
on Divinity, and left the work to be discharged by a
subordinate named Smallridge.</p>

<p>In 1703 Bishop Trelawny appointed him to the
Chancellorship of Exeter Cathedral, which he exchanged
for the precentorship in 1704, but he retained
his Regius professorship to the end. Undoubtedly it
was a great pleasure to him in the decline of his life to
be back in the West Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>He resigned the precentorship of Exeter in 1706, and
died on the 23rd February, 1707, at Oxford, and was
buried in Christ Church.</p>

<p>The writer of his life in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> sums up his career with these words: "Jane
was a clerical politician of a low type; Calamy says
of him, 'Though fond of the rites and ceremonies of
the Church, he was a Calvinist in the respect of
doctrine,' and the pleasantest thing recorded of him is
his kindness shown at Oxford to the ejected Presbyterian,
Thomas Gilbert."</p>

<p>Calamy, as a Dissenter, was prejudiced against
Jane; and I do not see that he was of a low type of
polemical cleric&mdash;because when he saw that the theory
of government he had embraced would not bear the
test of experience, he had the courage to reject it.
Every man is liable to make mistakes; it is only the
brave man who can acknowledge that he has been
mistaken.</p>

<p>Nor was Jane alone. Compton, Bishop of London,
and several other bishops, had appealed to William of
Orange to come over and help the people and the
Church of England to be free from a tyrannous and
subversive despotism. The Earl of Danby, under
whose administration, and with his sanction, a law had
been proposed, which, if it had passed, would have
excluded from Parliament and office all who refused to
declare on oath that they thought resistance to the
King in every case unlawful&mdash;he had seen the mistake
as well, and had invited William over.</p>

<p>As Macaulay says: "This theory (of passive
obedience) at first presented itself to the Cavalier as
the very opposite of slavish. Its tendency was to make
him not a slave, but a free man and a master. It
exalted him by exalting one whom he regarded as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
protector, as his friend, as the head of his beloved party,
and of his more beloved Church. When Republicans
were dominant the Royalist had endured wrongs
and insults which the restoration of the legitimate
government had enabled him to retaliate. Rebellion
was therefore associated in his imagination with subjection
and degradation, and monarchical authority
with liberty and ascendancy. It had never crossed his
imagination that a time might come when a King, a
Stuart, could prosecute the most loyal of the clergy and
gentry with more than the animosity of the Rump or
the Protector. That time had however arrived. Oppression
speedily did what philosophy and eloquence
would have failed to do. The system of Filmer might
have survived the attacks of Locke; but it never recovered
from the death-blow given by James."</p>

<p>Jane changed his opinion indeed, but so did nearly
the whole of the Tory party and of the clergy of the
Church.</p>

<h2>THE PENNINGTONS</h2>


<p>About seven years ago I attended the baptism
of some bells for a new church at Châteaulin,
in Brittany. The ceremony was quaint,
archaic, and grotesque. The bells were
suspended in the chancel "all of a row," dressed in
white frocks with pink sashes round their waists. To
each was given god-parents who had to answer for
them, and each was actually baptized, after which each
was made to speak for itself. The ceremony evidently
dates from a period when the bell was regarded as
anything but an inanimate object&mdash;it had its responsibilities,
it did its duties, it spoke in sonorous tones.
The very inscriptions on them to the present day
prescribe something of this character&mdash;invest each bell
with a personality, as these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>In the Western Counties bell-ringing was a favourite
and delightful pastime. Parties of ringers went about
from parish to parish and rang on the church bells,
very generally for a prize&mdash;"a hat laced with gold."
At Launcells, where the bells are of superior sweetness,
the ringers who rang for the accession of George III
rang for that of George IV, there not having been a
gap caused by death among them in sixty years. No
songs are so popular and well remembered at bell-ringers'
feasts as those that record the achievements of
some who went before them in the same office. I give
one that has never before been printed, that can be
traced back to 1810, but is certainly older. It relates to
the ringers of Egloshayle.</p>

<p>Humphry Craddock died in 1839; John Ellery in
1845, aged 85 years; John Pollard in 1825, aged 71;

1846, aged 80.</p>

<p>But for bell-ringers there must be bells; and who cast
those that have been in past years and are still pealed so
merrily? A great many were cast by the Penningtons
of Lezant, and latterly at Stoke Climsland. The Penningtons
were an ancient family in Bodmin, resident
there in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps because
not being landed gentry, perhaps because they could
not establish the right, they did not record their arms
or give their pedigree in the Heralds' Visitations. But
the coat they bore or assumed was a goodly one and
simple, and therefore ancient&mdash;<i>or</i>, in fesse five lozenges
<i>azure</i>. Robert Pennington, of Bodmin, had two sons&mdash;John,
baptized in 1595, and Bernard two years later.
John married at Bodmin, and had seven sons baptized
there, one of whom was probably the progenitor of the
Penningtons of Lezant and Stoke Climsland. The pedigree
of the Exeter bell-founders of the family has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
been made out; but that they belonged to the stock
that sprang up at Bodmin cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Bernard Pennington, baptized in 1605, was Mayor of
Bodmin in 1666, and was a bell-founder. He died in
1674. His son Christopher Pennington, baptized 1631,
was also a bell-founder. He died in 1696. Christopher's
son of the same name was Mayor of Bodmin in
1726, 1727, and 1733. He died in 1749. The Penningtons
seem to have abandoned the bell-casting business
at the beginning of the nineteenth century; but,
as Sir William Maclean says, "between 1702 and
1818 these popular founders cast nearly five hundred
bells in the county of Devon, and, it is believed, as
many in Cornwall."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>There are sixty-six in Devon cast by John Pennington,
of Exeter. The earliest that is dated is at Payhembury,
1635, and the latest 1690 at Kentisbeare. In
1669 T. P. and I. P. appear together on a bell at
Merton, as if they were partners; and ninety-five bear
the trade-mark of Thomas and John Pennington&mdash;large
Roman initials with a bell in outline between. The
earliest is found at Eggesford, 1618. Sometimes they
impressed the coin then current. At Ottery S. Mary,
1671, and at S. Martin's, Exeter, 1675, they used a
satirical medal representing a pope and a king under
one face, another representing a cardinal and a bishop.</p>

<p>Besides two generations of Penningtons in Exeter,
there was, as already stated, Christopher Pennington,
who cast a bell at Stowford dated 1710, and one at
Philleigh, in Roseland, with C. P. and the skeleton of
a bell between, as did the other Pennington. But his
earliest known is at Fremington, 1702. He was succeeded
by FitzAnthony Pennington, of Lezant, who
in 1768, whilst crossing the Tamar in the Antony ferry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
with a bell he had cast to be set up at Landulph, was
drowned. He is buried in the tower of Landulph, and
on a mural tablet, beside his age, which was thirty-eight,
and the date of his death, April 30th, 1768, are
these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' boisterous winds and billows sore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath toss'd me to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God's decree, in spite of both,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I rest now here below.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After his death we have the initials of the three
brothers, John, Christopher, and William. From their
head-quarters, first at Lezant and then at Stoke Climsland,
they itinerated through Cornwall and Devon,
casting bells wherever they could find deep clay, and
sufficient bell-metal was provided by the parish that
desired to have a bell in its tower, and generally the
bell was cast near the church for which it was intended.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There are as many as 480 bells by this Cornish
family from 1710-1818; their latest are at Bridgerule
and Bovey Tracey, at this last date.</p>

<p>William Pennington, son of the second Christopher,
entered Holy Orders and became vicar of Davidstowe.
His progenitors had furnished the voices calling to
church from the village towers, and now this member
sounded within the church also calling to prayer and
praise. His son, William Pennington, purchased the
site of the Priory, Bodmin, in 1788, having rebuilt the
house some twenty years previously under a lease.
He was mayor of Bodmin 1764, 1774, 1787, and died
without issue in 1789, bequeathing his possessions to
his niece Nancy Hosken, daughter of his sister
Susanna, who had married Anthony Hosken, vicar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of Bodmin and rector of Lesneuth. Nancy married
Walter Raleigh Gilbert, one of the gentlemen of the
bedchamber, and descended from the ancient Devonshire
family of Compton Castle. As Mr. Gilbert died
without issue, the Priory passed to his brother, and,
consequently, wholly away from the Penningtons.</p>

<h2>DOCTOR GLYNN-CLOBERY</h2>


<p>This amiable and good man was born at
Helland, 5th August, 1719, and was the son
of Robert Glynn, by Lucy, fourth daughter
of John Clobery, of Bradstone, in Devon.
A singular fatality attended this ancient family, that
possessed a very interesting Elizabethan mansion. John
Clobery had eight daughters and only one son and
heir, and that son died without issue, and only three
of the daughters married. Lucy had but the one son,
Robert Glynn, and the fifth daughter, Mary, also only
a son; and as these sons died unmarried, the estate
passed to remote connections.</p>

<p>Robert Glynn assumed his mother's name and succeeded
to the estates on the death of his uncle, William
Clobery. Robert Glynn was an M.D. and a Fellow of
King's College, Cambridge, where he resided. He
was a simple-minded man, and was completely taken
in by the Chatterton forgeries, and for some time
strenuously defended them. On which account Horace
Walpole speaks of him with great contempt as "an
old doting physician and Chattertonian at Cambridge."
"I neither answer Dr. Glynn, nor a <i>poissarde</i>.
Twenty years ago I might have laughed at both, but
they are too small fry, and I am too old to take notice
of them. Besides, when leviathans and crocodiles and
alligators tempest and infest the ocean, I shall not
go a-privateering in a cockboat against a smuggling
pinnace." That was in August, 1792.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Glynn was very fond of seeing young gownsmen
at his rooms, and had tea for them and conversed with
them; but he never drank tea himself. C. Carlyon
says: "His custom was to walk about the room and
talk most agreeably upon such topics as he thought
likely to interest his company, which did not often
consist of more than two or three persons. As soon as
the tea-table was set in order, and the boiling water
ready for making the infusion, the fragrant herb was
taken, not from an ordinary tea-caddy, but from a
packet, consisting of several envelopes curiously put
together, in the centre of which was the tea. Of this
he used, at first, as much as would make a good cup
for each of the party; and, to meet fresh demands, I
observed that he invariably put an additional teaspoonful
in the teapot; the excellence of the beverage,
thus prepared, ensuring him custom. He had likewise
a superior knack of supplying each cup with sugar from
a considerable distance, by a jerk of the hand which
discharged it from the sugar-tongs into the cup with
unerring certainty, as he continued his walk around the
table, scarcely seeming to stop whilst he performed
these and other requisite evolutions of the entertainment."</p>

<p>Dr. Glynn or Clobery would only eat when his appetite
summoned him imperiously for a meal. A faithful
old servant was in constant attendance upon him, and,
whenever his master called out for food, he was prepared
to set before him some plain dish and a pewter of porter.</p>

<p>Nothing would induce the doctor to believe that gout
was hereditary. He once took occasion to mark this
with peculiar emphasis, when a writer signing himself
W. A. A. consulted him in his first attack, then in
his nineteenth year. He observed, "My young
friend, you call this gout! Pooh, pooh! You have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
yet earned the costly privilege; you must drink your
double hogshead first."</p>

<p>"But my father, sir; it is in my blood by right of
inheritance."</p>

<p>His reply was, "You talk nonsense. You may as
well tell me you have a broken leg in your veins by inheritance."</p>

<p>One Sunday morning he met an undergraduate of
his acquaintance on his way to S. Mary's Church, and
said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my master, and whither are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to S. Mary's," replied the young
gownsman.</p>

<p>"And who is the preacher to-day?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Not know who is the preacher? Then, upon my
word, you have no small merit in taking pot-luck at
S. Mary's."</p>

<p>During a long illness the good old doctor attended
a poor man, of whose family party a pert, talkative
magpie made one; and as the patient observed that
Dr. Glynn always, when paying a visit, had some joke
with the bird, he thought that perhaps the doctor might
like to possess it. Accordingly, when the poor man
was well again, with overflowing gratitude, but with no
money to pay a bill, he thought he could do no better
than make his kind friend a present of the magpie;
and sure enough the prisoner in its cage was conveyed
to his rooms in King's College. There the bearer met
with a very kind reception, but was desired to carry
back the bird with him. "I cannot," said the doctor,
"take so good care of it as can you; but I shall consider
it mine, and I entrust it to you to keep for me;
and, as long as it lives, I will pay you half-a-crown
weekly for its maintenance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>The anecdote was turned into verse by Mr. Plumtre,
and is given in Gunning's <i>Reminiscences of Cambridge</i>.
When Dr. Glynn assumed the name of Clobery he
assumed also the Clobery arms&mdash;three bats; and no
animal could better symbolize the man, with his curious
blindness to what was obvious to most&mdash;that the Chatterton
papers were forgeries. He went down to Bristol
on purpose to examine the chest with its MS. contents.
The fact that in one of them the invention of heraldry
was ascribed to Hengest, and that of painted glass to
an unknown monk in the reign of King Edmund, did
not disturb his faith. He entered into vehement controversy
with George Steevens, in his endeavour to
establish their genuineness. He waxed hot over it, and
it took a good deal to put Glynn-Clobery out of his
usual placidity and coolness.</p>

<p>He set up to be a poet. His Seatonian prize poem
on the "Day of Judgment" was thought much of at the
time. Previously Christopher Smart had won the
prize over and over again. Glynn wrested the laurels
from him. This is not saying much; his poem was
not much better, and not at all worse, than the general
run of these prize poems. But it had the advantage
of pleasing, and has been repeatedly republished, and
has even obtained for the old doctor a niche in the
temple of Poesy&mdash;a notice in a <i>Biographical Dictionary
of Poets</i>.</p>

<p>He died at Cambridge on February 8th, 1800, and
at his own desire was buried at midnight in King's
College Chapel.</p>

<h2>THREE MEN OF MOUSEHOLE</h2>


<p>In the year 1849, Captain Allen Gardiner, an
intrepid sailor and a religious enthusiast, formed
the plan of converting the natives of Terra del
Fuego and of Patagonia. He knew nothing of
their language or habits, nothing indeed of their land.
He was, however, possessed with the idea that he was
called to be an apostle of those bleak and fog-wrapped
regions. Of all inhabited spots on the earth, the Terra
del Fuego is the most miserable. Cold, whirlwinds
and tempests of snow and hail, frozen fogs with but
rare glimpses of sunshine, form its climate; and the
natives are utterly barbarous, apparently the refugees
from the Continent, driven out of the somewhat less
desolate peninsula of Patagonia by the giants that now
possess it, and in their misery sinking to the lowest
depths to which man can descend.</p>

<p>During a year or more Captain Gardiner's efforts to
rouse interest in his scheme, sufficient interest to make
the money flow, had met with no success. He applied
to the Moravian Brethren to take up the mission; they
declined. Then he placed the matter before the Scottish
Establishment, but the canny Scotchmen would nae
think ov it. At last a lady at Cheltenham furnished
him with £700, and this, with £300 from his own
private purse, formed all the resources on which he
acted. As he could not afford to charter a schooner,
he had four open boats built for him at Liverpool.
Two of these were launches of considerable size, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
which he gave the names of the <i>Speedwell</i> and the
<i>Pioneer</i>; the other two were small dinghies, to be used
as tenders or luggage boats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/i_308.png" alt="DOROTHY PENTREATH" title="DOROTHY PENTREATH" />
   <p class="caption2">DOROTHY PENTREATH of MOUSEHOLE in CORNWALL<br />
<i>the last Person who could converse in the Cornish language?</i></p>
</div>

<p>Captain Gardiner now looked about him for enthusiasts
like himself to share the perils and the possible
glories of spreading the gospel over Terra del Fuego,
in which not a cross had been planted nor the Word
of God proclaimed.</p>

<p>He secured the services of a surgeon, a missionary,
and from Mousehole, near Penzance, drew three sturdy
Cornish sailors, or fishermen&mdash;John Pearce, John
Badcock, and John Davy Bryant&mdash;who little knew
what risks they ran.</p>

<p>The party left England on September 27th, 1850,
in the ship <i>Ocean Queen</i>, bound from Liverpool to
California, taking with them their boats and six
months' provisions. They were landed on the inhospitable
foreign shore on the 5th December.</p>

<p>Pinkerton, in his <i>Modern Geography</i>, thus graphically
describes the scene of their projected labours:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A broken series of wintry islands, called Terra del
Fuego, from two or more volcanoes which vomit
flames amidst the dreary wastes of ice. Terra del Fuego
is divided by narrow straits into eleven islands of considerable
size. In their zeal for Natural History, Sir
Joseph Banks and Doctor Solander had nearly perished
amid the snows of this horrible land; but they found
a considerable variety of plants. The natives are of
a middle stature, with broad flat faces, high cheeks,
and flat noses, and they are clothed in the skins of
seals. The villages consist of miserable huts in the
form of a sugar loaf, and the only food seems to be
shell-fish."</p>

<p>The lack of common prudence, of common sense,
exhibited by Captain Gardiner is astounding. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was he, with a party whom he had beguiled to attend
him, dropped in this barren country wrapped in snow
and fog, without an interpreter, and consequently without
the means of communication with the inhabitants
should they come across them. From the moment that
the sails of the <i>Ocean Queen</i> disappeared behind the
rocks on her way to double Cape Horn, the eye of no
civilized man ever saw these brave sailors and missionaries
alive. All that is known of them has been
gathered from the papers subsequently found.</p>

<p>Seven men in all, with four open boats, were left on
the most inhospitable coast that could be found, where
there is little food to be got, where vegetation is scarce.
Their resolution was heroic, but the whole enterprise
was madness.</p>

<p>They soon found that the <i>Pioneer</i> leaked. In several
short voyages from island to island and from shore to
shore they encountered numberless mishaps. The
natives were by no means friendly, and as they approached
their villages, brandished their weapons and
drove them away. At other times the Fuegians simulated
friendship, so as to get at the stores and plunder
them. During a storm both of the dinghies were lost
with all their contents, on which they relied for support
for six months. Next they found that they had no
gunpowder; it had been left inadvertently in the <i>Ocean
Queen</i>, so that they had no means of shooting birds or
other animals. Then their anchors and spare timber
were carried away. As far as we can judge, they seem
to have been curiously helpless persons. With clubs
they might have killed the sea-elephants, whose flesh
would have sustained them and their skins clothed
them.</p>

<p>Thus wore away the month of January, 1851, and
not the first step had been taken towards acquiring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
confidence of the natives. All the time had been spent
in a struggle for the maintenance of their own lives.
On February 1st the <i>Pioneer</i> was shattered in a storm,
and now they had only the <i>Speedwell</i> to voyage in,
a vessel whose name mocked their misery.</p>

<p>They all saw now, even the enthusiast Gardiner, that
they had embarked on an impossible task, and without
further thought of spreading a knowledge of Christianity
among the dirty, treacherous, flat-nosed and
stupid natives, their only consideration was how they
might get away.</p>

<p>Arrangements had been made before starting for
sending out to them fresh supplies, but by various unfortunate
mischances this had not been done. They
turned their eyes vainly eastward; not a sail was seen
to raise their hopes.</p>

<p>Some of the men became ill with scurvy, and the
boats were used as hospitals, the men that were sound
retiring to caverns. A few fish and fowl were caught,
and eggs were procured. So March and April dragged
along; and then the Antarctic winter began, adding
snow and ice to their other troubles. What herbs to
gather, how the natives protected themselves against
scurvy, does not seem to have occurred to these unfortunates.
They sat and shivered and lamented their
fate and lost all hope. From the middle of May they
were all put on short allowance, owing to the rapid disappearance
of the supply of food they had brought
ashore. At the end of June, Badcock, one of the
Mousehole men, died, worn out with scurvy. There
is an entry in Gardiner's diary, about the end of June,
enumerating the provisions still left, and among them
were "six mice," concerning which he wrote: "The
mention of this last item in our list of provisions may
startle some of our friends should it ever reach their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
ears; but circumstanced as we are, we partake of them
with a relish; they are very tender, and taste like
rabbit." A solitary penguin, a dead fox, a half-devoured
fish thrown up on the shore&mdash;all were welcomed
by the half-starved men. When August came,
the strength of the entire party was well-nigh at an end.
A few garden-seeds were made into a soup, and mussel-broth
was served out to the invalids. Captain Gardiner
himself lived on mussels for a fortnight, and then, as
this disagreed with him, was compelled to give up the
diet. He would have lain down and died of starvation
had he not found a vegetable that he could eat, and on
this he rallied for a while.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, Erwin, a boatman, died, exhausted by
hunger and disease. On the 26th, Bryant, the second
Mousehole man, expired. Pearce, the remaining boatman,
went nearly mad at the loss of his companions
and the hopelessness of the outlook. Mr. Maidment,
the missionary, had just strength sufficient to dig a
grave in which to bury the two poor fellows. He then
made a pair of crutches with two sticks, on which
Captain Gardiner might lean when walking. He lived
in the cavern, and tried to hobble down to those who
were in the <i>Speedwell</i>, but his strength was not equal to
the task, and he had to retire to his cave.</p>

<p>Maidment was the next to succumb, on September
2nd. Pearce, and Williams the surgeon, were in the
<i>Speedwell</i>, and it was as much as they could do to
obtain a few shell-fish for themselves; but they soon
lay down and died. When Gardiner also yielded up
the ghost is not known, but he had strength to make
an entry in his diary on the 6th; there is none on
the 7th.</p>

<p>On the 21st January, 1852, H.M.S. <i>Dido</i> arrived at
Terra del Fuego and found the remains of this unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
party of religious enthusiasts. The first thing
seen was a direction scrawled on a rock; then a boat
lying on the beach of a small river; then the unburied
bodies of Captain Gardiner and the missionary Maidment;
then a packet of papers and books; then the
scattered remains of another boat, with part of her gear
and various articles of clothing; then two more
corpses; and lastly the graves of the rest of the
party.</p>

<p>"Their remains," wrote Captain Morshead, of the
<i>Dido</i>, "were collected together and buried close to
the spot, and the funeral service read by Lieutenant
Underwood. A short inscription was placed on the
rock near his own text; the colours of the boats and
ships were struck half-mast, and three volleys of
musketry were the only tribute of respect I could
pay to the lofty-minded man and his devoted
companions."</p>

<h2>DOLLY PENTREATH</h2>


<p>Much has been written about Dolly
Pentreath, but little is known of her
uneventful life. That little may be
summed up in few words.</p>

<p>Her maiden name was Jeffery, and when she was
a child her parents and all about her spoke the Cornish
language. Drew, in his <i>History of Cornwall</i>, quoting
Daines Barrington, says: "She does indeed talk
Cornish as readily as others do English, being bred
up from a child to know no other language; nor could
she (if we may believe her) talk a word of English
before she was past twenty years of age."</p>

<p>In the year 1768 the Hon. Daines Barrington,
brother of Captain, afterwards Admiral, Barrington,
went into Cornwall to ascertain whether the Cornish
language had entirely ceased to be spoken, or not, and
in a letter written to John Lloyd, <span class="smcap">f.s.a.</span>, a few years
after, viz. on March 31, 1773, he gives the following
as the result of his journey:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I set out from Penzance, with the landlord of the
principal inn for my guide, towards Sennen, or the
most western point; and when I approached the village
I said that there must probably be some remains of the
language in those parts if anywhere, as the village was
in the road to no place whatever, and the only ale-house
announced itself to be the last in England.</p>

<p>"My guide, however, told me that I should be
disappointed, but that if I would ride about ten miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
about on my return to Penzance he would conduct me
to a village called Mousehole, on the western side of
Mount's Bay, where there was an old woman, called
Dolly Pentreath, who could speak Cornish fluently.
While we were travelling together towards Mousehole
I inquired how he knew that this woman spoke Cornish;
when he informed me that he frequently went from
Penzance to Mousehole to buy fish, which were sold
by her; and that when he did not offer her a price
that was satisfactory, she grumbled to some other
old women in an unknown tongue, which he concluded,
therefore, to be Cornish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_316.png" id="i_316.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_316.png" alt="MONSCHOLE, IN MOUNT'S BAY, FROM THE ISLAND" title="MONSCHOLE, IN MOUNT'S BAY, FROM THE ISLAND" />
   <p class="caption2">MONSCHOLE, IN MOUNT'S BAY, FROM THE ISLAND<br />
<i>From a drawing by Captain Tremenhere</i></p>
</div>

<p>"When we reached Mousehole I desired to be
introduced as a person who had laid a wager that there
was not one who could converse in Cornish; upon
which Dolly Pentreath spoke in an angry tone for two
or three minutes, and in a language which sounded
very like Welsh. The hut in which she lived was in a
very narrow lane, opposite to two rather better houses,
at the doors of which two other women stood, who
were advanced in years, and who I observed were
laughing at what Dolly said to me.</p>

<p>"Upon this I asked them whether she had not been
abusing me; to which they answered, 'Very heartily,'
and because I had supposed she could not speak
Cornish.</p>

<p>"I then said that they must be able to talk the
language; to which they answered that they could not
speak it readily, but that they understood it, being
only ten or twelve years younger than Dolly Pentreath.</p>

<p>"I continued nine or ten days in Cornwall after this,
but found that my friends whom I had left to the eastward
continued as incredulous almost as they were
before about these last remains of the Cornish language,
because, among other reasons, Dr. Borlase had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
supposed, in his <i>Natural History of the County</i>, that it
had entirely ceased to be spoken. It was also urged
that, as he lived within four or five miles of the old
woman at Mousehole, he consequently must have heard
of so singular a thing as her continuing to use the
vernacular tongue.</p>

<p>"I had scarcely said or thought anything more
about this matter till last summer (1772), having mentioned
it to some Cornish people, I found that they
could not credit that any person had existed within
these few years who could speak their native language;
and therefore, though I imagined there was but a
small chance of Dolly Pentreath continuing to live,
yet I wrote to the President, then in Devonshire, to
desire that he would make some inquiry with regard
to her; and he was so obliging as to procure me
information from a gentleman whose house was within
three miles of Mousehole, a considerable part of whose
letter I subjoin.</p>

<p>"'Dolly Pentreath is short of stature, and bends
very much with old age, being in her eighty-seventh
year, so lusty, however, as to walk hither to Castle
Horneck, about three miles, in bad weather, in the
morning and back again. She is somewhat deaf, but
her intellect seemingly not impaired; has a memory so
good, that she remembers perfectly well, that about
four or five years ago at Mousehole, where she lives,
she was sent for by a gentleman, who, being a stranger,
had a curiosity to hear the Cornish language, which
she was famed for retaining and speaking fluently,
and that the innkeeper where the gentleman came from
attended him.</p>

<p>("This gentleman," says Daines Barrington, "was
myself; however, I did not presume to send for her,
but waited upon her.")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"'She does, indeed, talk Cornish as readily as
others do English, being bred up from a child to know
no other language; nor could she (if we may believe
her) talk a word of English before she was past twenty
years of age, as, her father being a fisherman, she was
sent with fish to Penzance at twelve years old, and sold
them in the Cornish language, which the inhabitants
in general, even the gentry, did then well understand.
She is positive, however, that there is neither in
Mousehole, nor in any other part of the county, any
other person who knows anything of it, or, at least,
can converse in it. She is poor, and maintained partly
by the parish, and partly by fortune-telling and
gabbling Cornish.'</p>

<p>"I have thus," continued Mr. Barrington, "thought
it right to lay before the Society (the Society of
Antiquaries) this account of the last sparks of the
Cornish tongue, and cannot but think that a linguist
who understands Welsh might still pick up a more
complete vocabulary of the Cornish than we are yet
possessed of, especially as the two neighbours of this
old woman (Dolly Pentreath), whom I had occasion
to mention, are not now above seventy-seven or
seventy-eight years of age, and were healthy when
I saw them; so that the whole does not depend on
the life of this Cornish sybil, as she is willing to
insinuate."</p>

<p>It is matter of profound regret that no Welshman
did visit Dolly, who lived for four years after Mr.
Barrington's letter, which was written in 1773, for she
died December 26th, 1777.</p>

<p>Drew says: "She was buried in the churchyard of
the parish of Paul, in which parish, Mousehole, the
place of her residence, is situated. Her epitaph is both
in Cornish and English."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Coth Doll Pentreath cans ha Deau;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This epitaph, written by Mr. Tomson, of Truro, was never
inscribed on her tombstone, for no tombstone was set
up to her memory at the time of her death. The stone
now erected, and standing in the churchyard wall and
not near her grave, was set up by Prince Louis Lucien
Bonaparte in 1860, and contains two errors. It runs:
"Here lieth interred Dorothy Pentreath, who died in
1778." In the first place she does not lie where is
the stone, and in the second place she died 1777, on
December 26th, and was buried on the following day.</p>

<p>In 1776 Mr. Barrington presented a letter to the
Royal Society of Antiquaries written in Cornish and
in English, by William Bodener, a fisherman of Mousehole.
This man asserted that at that date there were
still four or five persons in Mousehole who could talk
Cornish.</p>

<p>In 1777, the year of Dolly's death, Mr. Barrington
found another Cornishman named John Nancarrow, of
Marazion, aged forty-five years, able to speak Cornish.
John Nancarrow said that "in his youth he had learned
the language from the country people, and could thus
hold a conversation in it; and that another, a native of
Truro, was at that time also acquainted with the
Cornish language, and like himself was able to converse
in it."</p>

<p>This last is supposed to be the Mr. Tomson who
wrote the epitaph for Dolly Pentreath which was never
set up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>In Hitchens' and Drew's <i>History of Cornwall</i>, it is
said: "The Cornish language was current in a part of
the South Hams in the time of Edward I (1272-1307).
Long after this it was common on the banks of the
Tamar, and in Cornwall it was universally spoken.</p>

<p>"But it was not till towards the conclusion of the
reign of Henry VIII (1509-47) that the English
language had found its way into any of the Cornish
churches. Before this time the Cornish language was
the established vehicle of communication.</p>

<p>"Dr. Moreman, a native of Southill, but vicar of
Menheniot, was the first who taught the inhabitants
of this parish the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the
Ten Commandments in the English tongue; and this
was not done till just about the time that Henry VIII
closed his reign. From this fact one inference is
obvious, which is, that if the inhabitants of Menheniot
knew nothing more of the English than what was thus
learnt from the vicar of the parish, the Cornish must
have prevailed among them at that time ... and as
the English language in its progress travelled from
east to west, we may reasonably conclude that about
this time it had not penetrated far into the county, as
Menheniot lies towards its eastern quarter.</p>

<p>"From the time the liturgy was established in the
Cornish churches in the English language, the Cornish
tongue rapidly declined.</p>

<p>"Hence Mr. Carew, who published his <i>Survey of
Cornwall</i> in 1602, notices the almost total extirpation
of the language in his days. He says, 'The principal
love and knowledge of this language liveth in Dr.
Kennall the civilian, and with him lyeth buried; for
the English speech doth still encroach upon it and
hath driven the same into the uttermost skirts of the
shire. Most of the inhabitants can speak no word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Cornish; but few are ignorant of the English; and yet
some so affect their airs, as to a stranger they will not
speak it; for if meeting them by chance you inquire
the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be,
"<i>Meea naurdua cowzasourzneck?</i>" (I can speak no
Saxonage).'</p>

<p>"Carew's <i>Survey</i> was soon followed by that of
Norden, by whom we are informed that the Cornish
language was chiefly confined to the western hundreds
of the county, particularly to Penwith and Kirrier, and
yet (which is to be marveyled) though the husband
and wife, parents and children, masters and servants,
etc., naturally communicate in their native language,
yet there is none of them in a manner but is able to
converse with a stranger in the English tongue, unless
it be some obscure people who seldom confer with the
better sort. But it seemeth, however, that in a few
years the Cornish will be by little and little abandoned."</p>

<p>The Cornish was, however, so well spoken in the
parish of Feock by the old inhabitants till about the
year 1640, "that Mr. William Jackman, the then vicar,
and chaplain also of Pendennis Castle, at the siege
thereof by the Parliament army, was forced for divers
years to administer the sacrament to the communicants
in the Cornish tongue, because the aged people did not
well understand the English, as he himself often told
me," says Hals.</p>

<p>So late as 1650 the Cornish language was currently
spoken in the parishes of Paul and S. Just; the fisherwomen
and market-women in the former, and the
tinner in the latter, for the most part conversing in
their old vernacular tongue; and Mr. Scawen says that
in 1678 the Rev. F. Robinson, rector of Landewednack,
"preached a sermon to his parishioners in the
Cornish language only."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the Bible been translated, had even the English
Prayer-book been rendered into Cornish, the language
would have lived on. It is due to a large extent to
this&mdash;the translation into Welsh&mdash;that in Wales their
ancient language has maintained itself.</p>

<p>The editors of the <i>Bibliotheca Cornubiensis</i> state that
Dorothy Jeffery, daughter of Nicolas Pentreath, was
baptized at Paul 17th May, 1714; and they conclude
that she was the Dolly Pentreath who died in 1777, and
that her age accordingly was sixty-three and not one
hundred and two.</p>

<p>But this is a mistake. Dolly was a Jeffery by birth
and married a Pentreath.</p>

<p>A story is told of Dolly in Mr. J. Henry Harris's
<i>Cornish Saints and Sinners</i>, "as current in Mousehole,
but whether true or well conceived it is not possible for
me to say."</p>

<p>It is to this effect: that on one occasion a deserter
from a man-of-war fled to her house for refuge, and as
there was a cavity in her chimney large enough to
contain a man, she thrust him into it, and threw a
bundle of dry furze on the fire, and filled the crock
with water. Into the middle of the kitchen she drew
a "keeve," which she used for washing, and when the
naval officer and his men in pursuit burst into her
house, Dolly was sitting on a stool, her legs bare and
her feet ready to be immersed in the keeve. She
screamed out on their entry that she was about to wash
her feet, and only waiting for the water to get hot
enough. The officer persisted in searching, and she gave
tongue in strong and forcible Cornish. She rushed to
the door and screamed to the good people of Mousehole,
that the lieutenant and his men had invaded her
house without leave, and were impudent and audacious
enough to ransack every other cottage in the place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The officer and his men withdrew without having seen
and secured their man; and that night a fishing lugger
stole out of Mousehole with the deserter on board and
made for Guernsey, which in those days was a sort of
dumping-ground for all kinds of rascals who were
"wanted" at home.</p>

<h2>ROBERT JEFFERY OF POLPERRO</h2>


<p>Mrs. Bray, in her novel <i>Trelawny of
Trelawne</i>, written in 1834, thus describes
Polperro as it was at that time. It has
lost much but not all of its picturesqueness.
Many of the old fishermen's cottages have been
pulled down, and their places taken by ugly modern
houses.</p>

<p>"Looe," says she, "beautiful as it is, is not to be
compared to Polperro, two miles distant from Trelawne.
The descent to it is so steep, that I, who was
not accustomed to the path, could only get down by
clinging to Mr. Bray's arm for support; it was slippery,
and so rocky that in some places there were steps cut
in the road for the convenience of the passenger. The
view of the little port, the old town in the bottom (if
town it can be called), the cliffs, and the spiked rocks
that start up in the wildest and most abrupt manner,
breaking the direct sweep of the waves towards the
harbour, altogether produced such a combination of
magnificent coast scenery as may truly be called sublime."</p>

<p>Long before this, in the reign of Henry VIII,
Leland, who visited it, wrote: "By est, the haven of
Fowey upon a iiii miles of&mdash;ys a smawle creke cawled
Paul <i>Pier</i>, and a symple and poore village upon the est
side of the same, of fisharmen, and the boetes ther
fishing by [be] saved by a <i>Peere</i> or key."</p>

<p>Robert Jeffery was the son of John Jeffery, bargeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
at Fowey, afterwards a publican at Polperro.
John Jeffery died in 1802, and his widow remarried
Benjamin Coad, blacksmith.</p>

<p>Robert was baptized at Fowey, 22nd January, 1790.
He was impressed for the Royal Navy, and was placed
on board H.M. brig <i>Recruit</i>, under Captain the Hon.
Warwick Lake, in 1807.</p>

<p>Warwick Lake was the third son of Gerard, first
Viscount Lake, so created in 1807, and he eventually
succeeded as third Viscount in 1836. His career in
the Navy had not been particularly creditable. In
November, 1803, he had been lieutenant on board the
frigate <i>Blanche</i>, Captain Zachariah Mudge, lying at
anchor off the entrance of Mancenille Bay, Isle of
S. Domingo. In the harbour lay the French cutter
<i>Albion</i>, armed with two 4-pounders, six swivels, and
twenty muskets, and manned by forty-three officers
and men, lying under the guns of the fort of Monte
Christo. A night attack was determined upon, and
Lieutenant Edward Nicolls, of the Marines, volunteered,
with one boat, to attempt cutting out the vessel.
His offer was accepted; and on the evening of the
4th November, the red cutter, with thirteen men, including
himself, pushed off from the frigate. Shortly
after Captain Mudge despatched the barge, with
twenty-two men, under the Hon. Warwick Lake, to
follow the red cutter and supersede Nicolls in the
command. As the barge approached the cutter,
Nicolls hailed her and demanded a united attack.
But Lake feared that the hazards were too great, and
instead of following he moved away to the north-west
side of the bay, leaving Lieutenant Nicolls to attack
unassisted. The red cutter, thus deserted, proceeded
dauntlessly on her way, and as soon as she arrived
within pistol-shot was hailed. Replying with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
hearty cheers the boat proceeded, and received in
quick succession two volleys of musketry. The first
passed over the heads of the British; but the second
severely wounded the coxswain, the man at the bow-oar,
and a marine. Before the French cutter could fire
a third time, Nicolls, at the head of his little party,
sprang on board of her. The French captain fired at
the lieutenant, and the ball passed round his body in
the flesh, and lodged in his right arm. At the same
moment the French captain was shot. After this, little
resistance was offered. The French officers and crew
were driven below, with the loss, beside the captain, of
five men wounded.</p>

<p>So far the battery had not fired, and Nicolls ordered
that the <i>Albion</i> should be got under sail, and the cable
was cut.</p>

<p>At this moment up came the barge, commanded by
Lieutenant the Hon. Warwick Lake. He took command
of the prize captured by Nicolls, and with two
boats towing her soon ran her out of gunshot of the
battery, which had now at last opened fire, and joined
the frigate in the offing.</p>

<p>Captain Mudge, in his report to the Admiralty, wrote:
"Having gained intelligence that there was a large
coppered cutter full of bullocks for the Cape laying
close under the guns of Monte Christi (four 24-pounders
and three field-pieces), notwithstanding her situation, I
was convinced we could bring her off; and at two this
morning <i>she was masterly and gallantly attacked by
Lieutenant Lake in the cutter</i>, and Lieutenant Nicolls, of
the Marines, in the barge, who cut her out. She is
ninety-two tons burden, etc. This affair lost me two
men killed, and two wounded."</p>

<p>As will be seen, this was a gross misstatement of
facts. The Hon. Warwick Lake was in the barge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
did nothing till the <i>Albion</i> had been captured by Lieutenant
Nicolls in the cutter. Nor was this all. Among
the two wounded, Lieutenant Nicolls, the hero of the
action, was not named. His wound was not a scratch,
but a hole on each side of his body and a ball in his
arm, that sent him bleeding to the cock-pit of the
<i>Blanche</i>.</p>

<p>The Patriotic Fund presented to Lieutenant Lake
"for his gallantry" a sword valued at £50, and he did
not blush to receive it, whereas Lieutenant Nicolls
received one valued at £30. Not till much later was it
discovered who had been the hero of the action, and
who the sneak who flourished the plumes due to
another.</p>

<p>In 1807 Lake was captain of the <i>Recruit</i>, an 18-gun
brig-sloop.</p>

<p>Jeffery, at the age of eighteen, had entered in 1807 on
board the <i>Lord Nelson</i> privateer of Plymouth; but
eight days after, when the privateer had put into Falmouth,
was pressed by an officer of the <i>Recruit</i>, which
soon after sailed for the West Indies. Jeffery was a
skulking, ill-conditioned fellow, who was caught stealing
a bottle of rum and was punished for it, and by his
own acknowledgment, on December 10th, went to the
spruce-beer cask and drew off about two quarts. A
shipmate saw and informed against Jeffery, and Captain
Lake ordered the sergeant of marines to "put him
in the black list," and he had the word <i>Thief</i> painted on
a bit of canvas and affixed to his back.</p>

<p>Edward Spencer, master, told his captain that the
fellow was no good on board, and that the best thing
that could be done with him was to put him on shore.</p>

<p>On the 13th December the <i>Recruit</i> was passing the
island of Sombrero, that lies between the islet of
Anyada in the Puerta Virgin Islands and that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Anguella in the Lesser Antilles group. It was towards
evening between five and six of the afternoon.
Captain Lake then ordered Jeffery to be brought on
deck, and saying that he would not keep such a worthless
scoundrel on the ship, gave orders to Lieutenant
Mould to have out the boat and convey Jeffery on
shore. Neither the captain nor any of the crew knew
that the island was desert and waterless. They believed
that it was inhabited by a few fishermen, and in
the evening light mistook some rocks on shore for
houses. Accordingly, a little before 6 p.m., Jeffery
was placed in a boat along with the second lieutenant
of the brig, Richard Cotten Mould, a midshipman,
and four sailors, and landed on Sombrero, without
shoes to his feet, or any other clothes than those on his
back, and without even a biscuit for food.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mould, seeing that the lad's feet were cut
and bleeding by stepping on the sharp-pointed rocks,
begged a pair of shoes for him from one of the seamen,
and gave him his knife and a couple of handkerchiefs,
to be made use of as signals, and advised him
to keep a sharp look-out for passing vessels. Then he
pulled back to the <i>Recruit</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Lake was possibly suffering from what would
now be termed a "swollen head." His father, a gallant
officer, but of no great descent, for his services in the
Maharatta war had been created Baron Lake of Delhi
and of Aston Clinton, Bucks, in 1804, and had received
thanks for his services by both Houses of Parliament.
His elder brother had married the sister of Charles,
Earl of Whitworth, and his father had been granted
an augmentation of arms, a fish naiant in fesse, to
represent the fish of the Great Mogul, pierced with
shafts.</p>

<p>Lake was a hot-headed man, and he had just dined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
That he intended to commit an act of barbarity is far
from the truth. Jeffery was a nuisance of which he
desired to free the ship, and the opportunity offered,
and he took advantage of it without stopping to inquire
what was the nature of the island on which he
left the young man.</p>

<p>On reaching the Leeward Islands, where Sir Alexander
Cochrane was in command of the squadron, that
officer heard of what Lake had done, promptly reprimanded
him, and ordered him to return to Sombrero
and fetch off Jeffery.</p>

<p>On February 11th, 1809, the <i>Recruit</i> anchored off
the island, and her officers landed and searched it over,
but neither Jeffery nor his body could be found. A
pair of trousers and a tomahawk handle were the only
vestiges of humanity discoverable. The island, however,
abounded in turtle and wild birds and their eggs,
but the water was brackish.</p>

<p>For eight days, in fact, Jeffery had wandered over
the hump of rock and sand that constituted the islet of
Sombrero, and lived on limpets and eggs, and drunk
the water collected in fissures of the rock. He does
not seem to have been given flint and steel, and the
means of making a fire, so that he could not feast on
turtle and puffins; but, indeed, there were no trees,
consequently hardly any fuel available for cooking a
dinner.</p>

<p>He saw several vessels pass, and indeed Sombrero was
in the track of merchant vessels, but he failed to make
them observe his signals. At length, on the morning
of the ninth day, the schooner <i>Adams</i>, of Marblehead,
Massachusetts, John Dennis master, came to the
island and took the fellow off, and landed him at
Marblehead, where he worked at a forge. Little
conscious that he was like to be made political capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of and to become of consequence, he did not even
trouble to write home to Polperro to announce his
safety and his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Sir A. Cochrane was satisfied that the man could
not have died on Sombrero, as his body was not discovered,
nor was he likely to die on an island abounding
in turtles and eggs; he concluded that he had
been carried away by one of the many ships that
passed. He convinced himself that Captain Lake had
been guilty of an illegal act, but had not desired to do
one that was cruel, and he hoped that the matter would
be forgotten after he had administered a reprimand.</p>

<p>But the story got about. It reached England. A
busybody, Charles M. Thomas, who had been purser
on board H.M. sloop <i>Demarara</i>, but had been imprisoned
on suspicion that he had defrauded the
Government, wrote home to Mr. C. Bathurst, brother of
the M.P. for Bristol, to this effect: "I deem it a duty I
owe to humanity, to inform you that Captain Lake,
when commander of the <i>Recruit</i>, set a man belonging
to that vessel on shore at Sombrero, an uninhabited
island in the Atlantic Archipelago, where he died
through hunger, or otherwise, for more was never
heard of him. This was known to Sir A. Cochrane,
who suffered this <i>titled murderer</i> to escape, and he is
now in command of the <i>Ulysses</i>." The letter was dated
March 24th, 1809, more than a year after Jeffery had
been left on Sombrero. Its purport was obvious
enough. Thomas wanted to be revenged on Cochrane
for looking into the matter of his alleged frauds.</p>

<p>The fat was now in the fire. Sir Francis Burdett
took the matter up, the Radicals throughout the
country made immense capital out of the starving to
death of a poor seaman by a member of a noble family.
The case was kept perseveringly before the public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
so that the Government was constrained to issue orders
for a strict inquiry to be made as to whether Jeffery
was still alive or dead.</p>

<p>Presently an account was received, purporting to be
by Jeffery, giving information relative to his rescue
and his condition in America; but as to this was
appended a cross for his signature, whereas Jeffery was
known to have been able to write, the public were led
to suspect that this was a fabrication contrived by
Lake's relatives and friends.</p>

<p>To settle the matter finally, a ship was despatched to
bring Jeffery home, and he arrived at Portsmouth in
October, 1810, three years after his adventure in
Sombrero, and to find himself the hero of a party.
On October 22nd he attended at the Admiralty, where
he received his discharge, and had the "R" taken off his
name, by which he became entitled to all arrears of
pay. The family of Captain Lake made him liberal
compensation for the very slight hardships he had
undergone, but which in Jeffery's own account and
in that of his partisans were magnified enormously.</p>

<p>On the 5th and 6th of February, 1810, a court-martial
assembled on board the <i>Gladiator</i> at Portsmouth to try
Captain Lake for having abandoned a seaman on a
desert and uninhabited island. Captain Lake complained
that the witnesses whom he might have
summoned to speak for him were away in various
ships in different parts of the world. He produced
a letter signed by all the officers of the <i>Ulysses</i>,
the vessel he then commanded, protesting that he was
humane and incapable of doing an act of wanton
cruelty.</p>

<p>At this time it was not known whether Jeffery was
alive or dead. Captain Lake made a manly defence.
"You will be pleased to recollect the evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Mr. Spencer, the chief witness on the part of the prosecution,
on this point. He himself advised me to get
the man out of the ship, and I declare that, by landing
him, I thought he would be made more sensible of his
want of conduct, and reform in future. I was persuaded
at the time that the island was inhabited; in
addition to which, I cannot but suppose it within your
knowledge that the island is not out of reach of human
assistance. I need not state that it is within the track
of vessels on particular destinations, and which frequently
pass within hail of the island. Jeffery found
this to be the case, and there is no reason to doubt but
that he was taken off the island; for on a search being
made for him there afterwards, one of the witnesses
states expressly that not a trace of him was to be
found, which I cannot conceive could have been the
case if he had perished there, as is most unwarrantably
asserted by Thomas. Gentlemen, I have no doubt he
was conveyed to America in perfect safety. I myself
verily believe he is in England at this moment,
consigned (as it were) to the merchants who, perhaps,
are keeping him concealed till the edict of the court-martial
is known, and then he may be let loose upon
me, to seek a compensation in damages by an action
at law. The place of his concealment, however, has
hitherto eluded the diligence of my agents."</p>

<p>He appealed to the official report made to the
Admiralty at the time by Sir A. Cochrane: "Be
pleased to consider attentively the statement made by
this official communication; contrast it with the letter
of Thomas, and then decide whether he was warranted
in asserting that Robert Jeffery had perished through
the inhumanity of one whom he has thought proper to
describe as a 'titled murderer.'"</p>

<p>The court-martial pronounced sentence: "Pursuant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to an order from the Right Honourable Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, dated 3rd February instant,
and directed to the President, setting forth that
a letter had been addressed to their Lordships by
the Right Hon. Charles Bathurst, enclosing a letter
to him from Mr. Charles Morgan Thomas, dated 24th
March, 1809 ... and having heard evidence produced
in support of the charge, and by the said Hon.
Warwick Lake in his Defence ... the Court is of
opinion, That the charge has been proved against the
said Hon. Warwick Lake, and doth adjudge him to
be dismissed from His Majesty's service; and the said
Hon. Warwick Lake is hereby dismissed from His
Majesty's service."</p>

<p>In 1836 the Hon. Warwick Lake succeeded to
the viscounty, and died in 1848, leaving behind him
only two daughters, one unmarried, the other married
to a Gloag. He was certainly very hardly treated, and
as certainly an utterly worthless scoundrel was exalted
into a hero. Jeffery returned to Polperro, where he
was received with curiosity. There his antecedents were
well known, and the value of his statements of terrible
privation taken for what they were worth. Elsewhere
he received an enthusiastic ovation. He hired himself
out to be "run" by speculators at some of the minor
theatres in London as "Jeffery the Sailor." After a
few months he returned to Polperro with money enough
in his pocket to enable him to purchase a small
schooner for the coasting trade.</p>

<p>The speculation did not answer his expectations.
He fell into consumption, and died in 1820, leaving a
wife and daughter in great penury. He was a mean, not
to say a despicable creature, who was used for political
purposes, and when he had served these was allowed to
drop into his proper insignificance.</p>

<h2>ADMIRAL RICHARD DARTON
THOMAS</h2>


<p>Richard Darton Thomas was born
at Saltash on 2nd June, 1777, son of
Charles and Mary Thomas of that place.
Drinking in the sea air, living in the midst
of sailors and fisher-folk, he early took a fancy for the
sea, and entered as an able-bodied seaman in the
Royal Navy, in 1790, at the age of thirteen. His intelligence,
his pleasant manners, won the regard of his
officers and he was raised to be midshipman in
1792, and became master's mate in the ensuing year.
He was in the <i>Boyne</i> under Sir John Jervis when
Martinique was captured, and on the return of the
<i>Boyne</i> to England, he was on board when that vessel
was burnt at Spithead, 1st May, 1795. The marines had
been exercising and firing on the windward side,
and it is supposed that some ignited paper of the
cartridges flew through the quarter-galley into the
admiral's cabin and communicated with the papers
lying about on the table. It was at 11 a.m. that the
fire broke out, the flames bursting through the poop
before the fire was discovered, and it spread so rapidly
that in less than half an hour this fine ship, in spite of
every exertion of the officers and crew, was in a blaze
fore and aft. As soon as the fire was discovered by
the fleet, all the boats of the ships proceeded to the
assistance of the <i>Boyne</i>, and the whole of the numerous
crew, except eleven, were saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Boyne's</i> guns being loaded went off as they
became heated, discharging their shot among the
shipping, whereby two men were killed and one wounded
on board the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>. At about half-past one
the <i>Boyne</i> burnt from her cables and drifted to the
east with a streamer of fire and smoke pouring from her;
she then grounded and continued to burn till six o'clock,
when the fire reached her magazine and she blew up.
This, as Captain Brenton wrote, "offered one of the most
magnificent sights that can be conceived. The afternoon
was perfectly calm and the sky clear; the flames
which darted from her in a perpendicular column of
great height were terminated by an opaque white cloud
like a round cap, while the air was filled with fragments
of wreck in every direction, and the stump of the
foremast was seen above the smoke descending to the
water."</p>

<p>We next find Thomas serving as lieutenant on
board the <i>Excellent</i>, commanded by Captain Collingwood,
in the battle off Cape S. Vincent. It was intended
that the Spanish fleet should join that of Brest, if
this latter could get out, then if joined by the Dutch
fleet, cover the transports that would convey an invading
army to England. But, as Touchstone wisely said,
there is "much virtue in <i>If</i>." Sir John Jervis fell in
with the Spanish fleet of twenty-seven sail of the line, on
February 14th, 1797, as it had just issued from Cadiz.
The English had only fifteen men-of-war; but the
greater part of the Spanish crew were about equally
destitute of seamanship and spirit, and Nelson had said
just before the breaking out of the war with Spain, that if
her fleet were no better now than when it acted in
alliance with us it would "soon be done for." By
breaking the line, by battering and boarding, four
Spanish ships of the line, including one of 112 guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
were taken; and all the rest were driven into Cadiz and
there blockaded.</p>

<p>During the action the <i>Excellent</i>, on which Richard
Thomas was lieutenant, was acknowledged by Nelson
to have taken a very distinguished share, and to have
rendered him the most effectual support in the hottest
part of the battle, as will be seen by the following note
which he addressed to her commander, and an extract
from his own account of the transactions in which he
himself was personally engaged.</p>

<p>His note ran: "Dear Collingwood,&mdash;A friend in
need is a friend indeed."</p>

<p>Nelson's account of the assistance he received from
the <i>Excellent</i> runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At this time (about 2.15 p.m.) the <i>Salvador del
Mundo</i> and <i>San Esidero</i> dropped astern, and were fired
into, in a masterly style, by the <i>Excellent</i>, Captain
Collingwood, who compelled the <i>San Esidero</i> to hoist
English colours; and I thought the large ship, the
<i>Salvador del Mundo</i>, had also struck, but Captain
Collingwood, disdaining the parade of taking possession
of a vanquished enemy, most gallantly pushed
up, with every sail set, to save his old friend and messmate,
who was to appearance in a critical state, the
<i>Blenheim</i> being ahead, the <i>Culloden</i> crippled and astern.
The <i>Excellent</i> ranged up within two feet of the <i>San
Nicholas</i>, giving a most tremendous fire. The <i>San
Nicholas</i> luffing up, the <i>San Josef</i> fell on board her;
and the <i>Excellent</i> passing on for the <i>Santa Trinidada</i>,
the Captain resumed her station abreast of these, and
close alongside."</p>

<p>The <i>Excellent</i>, in fact, succeeded in getting close
under the lee of the <i>Santissima Trinidada</i>, mounting
130 guns, and engaged her for nearly an hour, assisted
by the <i>Orion</i>, the <i>Irresistible</i>, and the <i>Blenheim</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
huge vessel was compelled to haul down her colours, but
the approach of thirteen other Spanish ships prevented
her opponents from profiting by the advantage they
had gained. The total loss on the <i>Excellent</i> amounted
to eleven men killed and a dozen wounded.</p>

<p>We need not follow Richard D. Thomas through his
various changes of ships. He was mainly with Collingwood,
whose flag, as Rear-Admiral of the White, was
flying on board the <i>Barfleur</i>, of ninety-eight guns.
With him he remained on Channel service till the
suspension of hostilities in 1802. He was given the
rank of commander in 1803, when in the <i>Chichester</i> off
Halifax.</p>

<p>Returning from Nova Scotia, as a passenger on board
the packet <i>Lady Hobart</i>, commanded by Captain Fellowes,
he experienced shipwreck and terrible hardships,
by the vessel running on an iceberg.</p>

<p>After giving an account of his sailing from Halifax,
June 22nd, 1803, and the capture of a French schooner
laden with salt fish on the 26th, Captain Fellowes
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Tuesday, 28th June.</i>&mdash;Blowing hard from the westward,
with a heavy sea and hazy weather, with intervals
of thick fog. About 1 a.m. the ship, then going
by the log at the rate of seven miles an hour, struck
against an island of ice with such violence that several
of the crew were pitched out of their hammocks. Being
roused out of my sleep by the suddenness of the shock,
I instantly ran upon the deck. The helm being put
hard aport, the ship struck again about the chest-tree,
then swung round on her keel, her stern-post being
stove in, and her rudder carried away before we could
succeed in an attempt to haul her off. At this time the
island of ice appeared to hang quite over the ship,
possessing a high peak, which must have been at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
twice the height of our masthead; and we suppose the
length of the island to have been from a quarter to half
a mile.</p>

<p>"The sea was now breaking over the ice in a dreadful
manner, the water rushing in so fast as to fill the
hold in a few minutes. Hove the guns overboard, cut
away the anchors from the bows, got two sails under
the ship's bottom, kept both pumps going, and baling
with buckets at the main hatchway, in the hope of preventing
her from sinking; but in less than a quarter
of an hour she settled down in her forechains in the
water.</p>

<p>"Our situation was now become most perilous.
Aware of the danger of a moment's delay in hoisting
out the boats, I consulted Captain Thomas of the
Navy, and Mr. Bargus, my master, as to the propriety
of making any further attempts to save the ship."</p>

<p>Both declared that nothing effectual could be done to
the vessel herself, and that, as every moment was
precious, the boats should be got out and manned. Of
these there were two, the cutter and the jolly-boat, and
the ladies were placed in the former.</p>

<p>Captain Fellowes expressed himself afterwards
warmly of the ability and readiness with which Captain
Thomas aided him. In bringing the ladies into the
cutter, one of them, Miss Cottenham, was so terrified
that she sprang from the wreck and pitched in the
bottom of the boat with considerable violence. This
accident might have been serious, but happily she was
not injured.</p>

<p>"The few provisions which had been saved from the
men's berths were then put into the boats. By this time
the main deck forward was under water, and nothing
but the quarter-deck appeared; I then ordered my men
into the boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ship was sinking fast, and I called to the men
to haul up and receive me, intending to drop into the
cutter from the end of the trysail boom.</p>

<p>"The sea was running so high at the time we hoisted
out the boats that I scarcely flattered myself we should
get them out safely; and, indeed, nothing but the
steady and orderly conduct of the crew could have
enabled us to effect so difficult and hazardous an undertaking;
it is a justice to them to observe that not a
man in the ship attempted to make use of the liquor,
which every one had in his power.</p>

<p>"We had scarce quitted the ship when she suddenly
gave a heavy lurch to port, and then went down foremost.
I cannot attempt to describe my own feelings,
or the sensations of my people, exposed as we were, in
two small open boats, upon the great Atlantic Ocean,
bereft of all assistance but that which our own exertions,
under Providence, could afford us, we narrowly escaped
being swallowed up in the vortex.</p>

<p>"We rigged the foremast, and prepared to shape our
course in the best manner that circumstances would
admit of, the wind blowing from the precise point on
which it was necessary to sail to reach the nearest land.
An hour had scarcely elapsed from the time the ship
struck till she foundered. The distribution of the crew
had already been made in the following order, which
we afterwards preserved:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the cutter were embarked three ladies and
myself, Captain Richard Thomas; the French commander
of the schooner; the master's mate, gunner,
steward, carpenter, and eight seamen; in all eighteen
people, whose weight, together with the provisions,
brought the boat's gunwale down to within six or seven
inches of the water. From this confined space some
idea may be formed of our crowded state; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
scarcely possible for the imagination to conceive the
extent of our sufferings in consequence.</p>

<p>"In the jolly-boat were embarked Mr. Samuel Bargus,
master; Lieut.-Colonel George Cocks, of the 1st
Regiment of Guards;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the boatswain, sailmaker, and
seven seamen&mdash;in all eleven persons.</p>

<p>"The only provisions, etc., we were enabled to save
consisted of between forty and fifty pounds of biscuits,
one vessel containing five gallons of water, a small jug
of the same, and part of a small barrel of spruce beer;
one demi-john of rum, a few bottles of port wine, with
two compasses, a quadrant, a spy-glass, a small tin
mug, and a wine-glass. The deck lantern, which had
a few spare candles in it, had been likewise thrown into
the boat; and the cook having had the precaution to
secure the tinder-box and some matches that were kept
in a bladder, we were afterwards enabled to steer by
night.</p>

<p>"The wind was now blowing strong from the westward,
with a heavy sea, and the day just dawned.
Estimating ourselves to be at the distance of 350 miles
from S. John's, Newfoundland, with a prospect of a
continuance of westerly winds, it became necessary to
use the strictest economy. I represented to my companions
in distress that our resolution, once made,
ought on no account to be changed, and that we must
begin by suffering privations, which I foresaw would
be greater than I ventured to explain. To each person,
therefore, were served out half a biscuit and a glass of
wine, which was the only allowance for the ensuing
twenty-four hours, all agreeing to leave the water
untouched as long as possible."</p>

<p>On the following day even this small allowance had
to be contracted, in consequence of the biscuit being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
much damaged by salt water during the night. "Soon
after daylight we made sail, with the jolly-boat in tow,
and stood close-hauled to the northward and westward,
in the hope of reaching the coast of Newfoundland or of
being picked up by some vessel. Passed two islands
of ice. We now said prayers, and returned thanks to
God for our deliverance."</p>

<p>It was now the 4th July. The sufferings of those in
the boats became excessive. The commander of the
French schooner that had been captured went mad, and
threw himself overboard. One of the French prisoners
became so outrageous that it was found necessary to
lash him to the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>At last, on this same day, the 4th July, after seven
days of dreadful privation and incessant storm, they
reached Conception Bay, in the Avalon Peninsula,
Newfoundland. They had been reduced to a quarter of
a biscuit per diem and a wine-glass of port wine and
spirit, and then of water.</p>

<p>Captain Fellowes says: "Overpowered by my own
feelings, and impressed with the recollections of our
sufferings and the sight of so many deplorable objects, I
promised to offer up our solemn thanks to heaven for our
miraculous deliverance. Every one cheerfully assented,
and as soon as I opened the Prayer-book there was an
universal silence. A spirit of devotion was singularly
manifested on this occasion, and to the benefits of a
religious sense in uncultivated minds must be ascribed
that discipline, good order, and exertion, which even
the sight of land could scarcely produce.</p>

<p>"The wind having blown with great violence from
off the coast, we did not reach the landing-place at
Island Cove till four o'clock in the evening. All the
women and children in the village, with two or three
fishermen (the rest of the men being absent), came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
down to the beach, and appearing deeply affected at
our wretched situation, assisted in carrying us up the
craggy rocks, over which we were obliged to pass to
get to their habitations.</p>

<p>"The small village afforded neither medical aid nor
fresh provisions, of which we stood so much in need,
potatoes and salt fish being the only food of the
inhabitants. I determined, therefore, to lose no
time in proceeding to S. John's, having hired a small
schooner for that purpose. On the 7th July we
embarked in three divisions, placing the most infirm
in the schooner, the master's mate being in charge of
the cutter, and the boatswain of the jolly-boat; but
such was the exhausted state of nearly the whole party,
that the day was considerably advanced before we
could get under way.</p>

<p>"Towards dusk it came on to blow hard in squalls
off the land, when we lost sight of the cutter, and were
obliged to come to anchor outside S. John's Harbour.
We were under great apprehensions for the cutter's
safety, as she had no grapnel, and lest she should be
driven out to sea, but at daylight we perceived her and
the schooner entering the harbour.</p>

<p>"The ladies, Colonel Cooke, Captain Thomas, and
myself, having left the schooner when she anchored,
notwithstanding the badness as well as extreme darkness
of the night, reached the shore about midnight.
We wandered for some time about the streets, there
being no house open at that late hour, but were at
length admitted into a small tenement, where we
passed the remainder of the night on chairs, there
being but one miserable bed for the ladies. Early on
the following day, our circumstances being made
known, hundreds of people crowded down to the landing-place.
Nothing could exceed their surprise on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
seeing the boats that had carried twenty-nine persons
such a distance over a boisterous sea, and when they
beheld so many miserable objects, they could not conceal
their emotions of pity and concern."</p>

<p>It was found that the greatest circumspection had to
be used in administering nourishment to those who
came on shore. They were so much frost-bitten, moreover,
as to require constant surgical assistance. Many
had lost their toes, and they were constrained to remain
at S. John's till they were in a fit state to be removed
to Halifax.</p>

<p>On the 11th July Captain Fellowes, with Captain
Thomas, and Lieutenant-Colonel Cooke, engaged the
cabin of a small vessel, bound for Oporto, so as to
return to England.</p>

<p>When Captain Fellowes sent in his report on the
loss of the <i>Lady Hobart</i>, he added a postscript: "I
regret that, in the hurry of drawing up this narrative,
I should have omitted to make particular mention of
Captain Richard Thomas, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span>, from whose great professional
skill and advice throughout our perilous
voyage I derived the greatest assistance."</p>

<p>In December, 1803, Captain Thomas commissioned
the <i>Ætna</i> bomb, and soon after joined the fleet under
Lord Nelson in the Mediterranean station, where
he was very actively employed up to the battle of
Trafalgar. After that he served as flag-captain under
his old friend and patron, Lord Collingwood.</p>

<p>In February, 1811, he was appointed to the <i>Undaunted</i>,
employed in co-operation with the Spanish patriots off
the coast of Catalonia. He was subsequently employed
in command of a squadron stationed in the Gulf of
Lyons, blockading Toulon. He was made Vice-Admiral
of the Blue in 1848; Admiral of the Blue,
1854; Admiral of the White, 1857, in which year he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
died, and was buried at Stonehouse, 27th August.
He married, in 1827, Gratiana, daughter of Lieutenant-General
Richard Williams, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span></p>

<p>His brother, Charles Thomas, <span class="smcap">m.d.</span>, was for some
time physician to the Devonport Dispensary.</p>

<h2>COMMANDER JOHN POLLARD</h2>


<p>Little did John Pollard as signal midshipman
of the <i>Victory</i> in the battle of Trafalgar
suppose that he was running up a message
to the fleet from Nelson that would never be
forgotten so long as the English name lasts, and the
Englishman maintains the character which has ever
belonged to him.</p>

<p>He was the son of John Pollard, and entered the
Navy on November 1st, 1797. Before the battle commenced
Nelson dictated the signal, "England <i>confides</i>
that every man will do his duty." Pollard, to whom
the order was given, remarked that the word <i>confides</i>
was not in the code, and suggested in its stead the
term <i>expects</i>, which Nelson at once accepted. Napoleon
so much admired this last order of Nelson's that he
caused it to be printed, with a difference, of France for
England, and commanded that a copy should be given
to each of the officers of the navy. "It is the best of
lessons," he said.</p>

<p>Pollard was born at Kingsand, Cornwall, on 27th
July, 1787, so that he was aged but eighteen when
he suggested the alteration in Nelson's famous message,
and saw it signalled to the fleet. He died in the
Royal Hospital, Greenwich, 22nd April, 1868, at the
advanced age of eighty-one. He did nothing further
that was remarkable, and is remembered only in connection
with Nelson's signal, an instance of:&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE CASE OF BOSAVERN PENLEZ</h2>


<p>At the end of June, 1749, a sailor was robbed
in a low, disreputable house in the Strand.
He stormed and demanded the restoration
of his purse, but could obtain no redress;
he was laughed at and ejected from the place. He at
once returned to his vessel and narrated his wrongs,
and so roused the resentment of his comrades that they
promised to accompany him to the Strand and work
retribution on the thieves.</p>

<p>Accordingly on July 1st a body of them marched down
the Strand, and reaching the house broke in the door
and "levell'd their rage against the house and goods of
the caitif, whom they looked on as the author of the
villainy exercised on their brother Tar. Accordingly
they went to work as if they were breaking up a ship,
and in a trice unrigg'd the house from top to bottom.
The movables were thrown out of the windows or doors
to their comrades in the street, where, a bonfire being
made, they were burnt, but with so much decency and
order, so little confusion, that notwithstanding the
crowd gather'd together on this occasion, a child of five
years old might have crossed the street in the thickest
of them without the least danger.</p>

<p>"The neighbours, too, though their houses were
not absolutely free from danger of fire by the sparks
flying from the bonfire, were so little alarm'd at this
riot that they stood at their doors, and look'd out of
their windows, with as little concern, and perhaps more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
glee and mirth, than if they had been at a droll in
Bartholomew Fair, seeing the painted scene of the
renoun'd Troy Town in flames." After the house had
been completely gutted, and not before, the guards
came from the Savoy, which, by the way, was not
above a good stone's throw from the scene of action,
whereupon the sailors withdrew, unarrested and unpursued.
If matters had remained here it would have
been well, but unhappily this first performance whetted
the appetites of the sailors for another, and they resolved
on sacking another house a few doors from that they
had gutted, which also did not bear a good character.</p>

<p>Accordingly next evening, being Sunday, they returned,
and proceeded to treat this second house in the
same manner as the first "without so much as the least
interruption, till they had full timely notice to get off
before the guards arrived, who came, as before, too
late, that one would have been tempted to imagine they
came too late on purpose.</p>

<p>"A regular bonfire then having been made as before,
all the goods of the house were triumphantly convey'd
into it; and if the finding of bundles and effects of any
of the actors would have aggravated their guilt, numbers
might have been seized with the goods upon them,
between the house and the bonfire, where they were all
carefully destroy'd, to avoid any slur or suspicion of pillage
for private use. This was carry'd to such an exactness
that a little boy, who perhaps thought no great harm
to save a gilt cage out of the fire for his bird at home,
was discover'd carrying it off, when the leaders of the
mob took it from him and threw it into the fire, and
his age alone protected him from severe punishment.
Nothing, in short, was imbezzled or diverted, except an
old gown or petticoat, thrown at a hackney coachman's
head as a reward for a dutiful Huzza, as he drove by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"As to the neighbours, who were at their doors and
windows seeing the whole without the least concern or
alarm, there was not probably one of those who, though
as good and as loyal subjects as any his Majesty has,
and as well affected to the peace and quiet of his
government, imagin'd or dream'd there was any spirit
of sedition or riotous designs in these proceedings
beyond the open and expressed intention of destroying
these obnoxious houses; and tho' the coolest and sensiblest
doubtless thought the joke was going too far, and
wished even that the Government had interposed
sooner, and less faintly, yet they had not the least
notion of any such extraordinary measure of guilt in
their proceedings as would affect life or limb."</p>

<p>The sailors had now gathered about them, some as
lookers on, some as assistants, a large number of men
and boys, and these now moved up the street in a body,
with a bell ringing before them, to the house of one
Peter Wood, a hairdresser, but in bad odour, as keeping
a disorderly house, under the sign of the Star.</p>

<p>Into this house the mob broke, although Peter Wood
offered money if only they would spare him and its
contents. But they were deaf to his entreaties, and his
house was only saved by the arrival of the guards, who
at once proceeded to arrest several persons. Among
those they secured was Bosavern Penlez, or Penlees,
son of a clergyman in Cornwall, who had been put
apprentice to a wig-maker in town.</p>

<p>With him were secured John Wilson, Benjamin
Lander, and another, who shortly after died of gaol-fever
in Newgate. All these four, not one of whom
was a sailor, were locked up in prison, and kept there
till the September Sessions, when they were indicted
"for that they, together with divers other persons, to
the number of forty and upwards, being feloniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and riotously assembled, to the disturbance of the
public peace, did begin to demolish the house of Peter
Wood against the form of the statute in that case
made and provided, July the 3rd."</p>

<p>Against Lander, Peter Wood swore that "he was in
the passage of his house, assisting to break the partition;
that that was the first time of his seeing him;
that he broke the window of the bar with his stick; that
he (Lander) was taken upstairs."</p>

<p>On a cross-examination he averred that he did not
see Lander at the first coming up of the mob to his
house; but he asserted that he stuck fast to him when
he saw him in the passage, which was half an hour
before the arrival of the guards.</p>

<p>Peter Wood's wife swore that Lander had knocked
her down, and had beaten her almost to a jelly.</p>

<p>Lander, in his defence, proved that between twelve
and one o'clock that night he was going home to his
lodgings, when he heard that there was a riot in the
Strand; and that meeting with a soldier who had been
ordered with his detachment to disperse the mob in the
Strand, he persuaded him to enter with him into a
public-house and have a drink. The soldier consented,
and then left, and Lander followed to see the fun, and
found the mob retreating to Temple Bar, driven forward
by the guards. Thereupon, according to his own
account, he went into Peter Wood's house to see what
mischief had been done, when Wood laid hold of him,
under the notion that he was a straggler left behind of
those who had begun to wreck the house. Happily at
that moment in came the soldier whom Lander had
treated to a pint of beer. The evidence of this soldier
was conclusive, and Lander was discharged, after
having suffered imprisonment for over two months.</p>

<p>It appears evident that Peter Wood's testimony was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
false; not perhaps purposely so, but erroneous through
his mistaking one man for another in the excitement of
the partial destruction of his house.</p>

<p>The evidence he gave against John Wilson was that
the man knocked him down, and that Wilson, stooping
over him, asked, "You dog, are you not dead yet?"
and that he caught hold of Wilson's hand and kissed it
and prayed for mercy. Moreover, Mrs. Wood testified
that she also had entreated him to stay his hand, and
had "held him by the face, and stroked him." The
waiting-man clinched the testimony by swearing that
he also had seen Wilson in the parlour as the settee-bed
was being thrown out of the window, and that he
(Wilson) helped to throw the bed out. John Wilson
earnestly protested that a mistake had been made, and
that he was not the man who had done that of which he
was accused. He brought numerous testimonies to his
good character; but these availed not, and he was condemned
to death.</p>

<p>Bosavern Penlez admitted that he had been in Peter
Wood's house; he had been rather tipsy at the time,
and had been drawn in to follow the mob, but he had
done no mischief, neither had he joined the rabble with
any evil intent. This availed not; he also was condemned
to death. At the last moment Wilson was
reprieved and finally pardoned; but poor Bosavern was
hanged at Tyburn on the 18th October, 1749, at the
age of twenty-three.</p>

<p>Much feeling had been roused in favour of Penlez,
and a petition had been got up, numerously signed,
requesting that he might be pardoned; but it availed
nothing. Then a pamphlet appeared, entitled, <i>The
Case of the Unfortunate Bosavern Penlez</i>, published
by T. Clement, S. Paul's Churchyard, 1749.</p>

<p>As this was widely disseminated, and comments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
passed that a grievous injustice had been committed,
Henry Fielding, the magistrate, published an answer,
entitled <i>A True State of the Case of Bosavern Penlez</i>.
A. Miller, Strand, 1749.</p>

<p>According to this, on July 1st the house of one
Owen, in the Strand, had been attacked. Nathaniel
Munns, beadle, had tried to stop it, and two rioters
were taken by the constables and conveyed to the
prison of the Duchy of Lancaster Liberty. On Sunday,
July 2nd, there was a recurrence of the riot, outside the
beadle's house; the windows were broken, the bars
wrenched away, and the prisoners were released, and
doors and windows of the watch-house were smashed.</p>

<p>John Carter, constable, gave evidence as to July 1st,
that two wagon-loads of goods had been consumed by
fire outside Owen's house. He appealed to General
Campbell, at Somerset House, for assistance, and the
General sent twelve of the Guards, when the rioters
retreated, and began an attack on the house of one
Stanhope, throwing stones, breaking windows, and
pelting the soldiers, so that soon forty men of the
Guards had to be despatched to disperse the rioters.</p>

<p>On Sunday, July 2nd, according to the constable,
the mob again assembled in front of Stanhope's house
and demolished its contents. Mr. Wilson, a woollen
draper, and Mr. Actor, of the same trade, applied
for protection, as their shops adjoined the house of
Stanhope, and again soldiers were sent for, who dispersed
the mob.</p>

<p>James Cecil, Constable of St. George's parish, deposed
that on Monday, July 3rd, he was attending
prisoners in a coach to Newgate, and he had difficulty
in making his way through the mob; and he saw the
rioters engaged in smashing the windows of a house
near the Old Bailey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Saunders Welsh, gent., High Constable of Holborn,
deposed that on Sunday, July 2nd, he had received
information from Stanhope, as to the wrecking of Owen's
house on the previous night, and of his fears for his
own. On returning that same evening through Fleet
Street, he perceived a great fire in the Strand, upon
which he proceeded to the house of Peter Wood, who
informed him that the rioters had demolished the house
of Stanhope, burning his furniture and goods, and
that they threatened to deal in the same manner with
his house. Whereupon, he, Mr. Saunders Welsh,
applied at the Tilt-yard for a military force, which he
could only obtain with much difficulty, as he could
produce no order from a Justice of the Peace. At
length he procured such order, and then an officer
and forty men were sent to the scene of the riot. On
reaching Cecil Street, he ordered that the drum should
be beaten. When he came up to Peter Wood's house,
he found that the mob had already in part demolished
it, and had thrown a great part of its contents into the
street, and were debating about burning them. Had
they done so, the deponent said, it would infallibly
have set fire to the houses on both sides of the street,
which at that point was very narrow, and opposite
Wood's house was the bank of Messrs. Snow and
Denne. Hearing, however, the rattle of the drum,
and the tramp of the advancing soldiers, the mob
retreated, and it was whilst so retreating that Bosavern
Penlez was arrested, carrying off with him some of
the goods of Peter Wood.</p>

<p>Penlez and others were brought before Henry
Fielding, J. P. for Middlesex, and were committed to
Newgate. This was on Monday. But the same evening
there was a recrudescence of the riots, and four
thousand sailors assembled on Tower Hill with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
resolution to march to Temple Bar. To obviate all
future danger, a larger party of soldiers was called
out, and these, along with the peace officers, patrolled
the Strand all night.</p>

<p>Samuel Marsh, watchman of St. Dunstan's, had
apprehended Bosavern Penlez, as he was making off
with a bundle of linen, which he pretended belonged
to his wife. Before he was arrested, the watchman
saw him thrusting divers lace objects into his bosom
and pockets, but he let fall a lace cap. When apprehended,
he protested that he was conveying his wife's
property, who had pawned all his clothes, and that he
was retaliating by taking her articles to pawn.</p>

<p>There were other witnesses against Penlez, and
although the evidence of Peter Wood was worthless,
that of the beadles and watchmen sufficed to show
that he had been collecting and making into a bundle
various articles from Wood's house, with the object
of purloining them. The question of Penlez having
been in Wood's house was not gone into. Bosavern
in vain called for witnesses to his character. His
master, the peruke maker, declined to put in an appearance
and give favourable testimony; for, in fact,
Penlez had been leading a dissipated and disorderly
life. Henry Fielding, in conclusion, says: "The first
and second day of the riot, no magistrate, nor any
other higher peace-officer than a petty constable (save
only Mr. Welsh) interfered in it. On the third day
only one magistrate took on him to act. When the
prisoners were committed to Newgate, no public prosecution
was for some time ordered against them; and
when it was ordered, it was carried on so mildly, that
one of the prisoners (Wilson) being not in prison,
was, though contrary to the laws, at the desire of a
noble person in great power, bailed out, when a capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
indictment was then found against him. At the trial,
neither an Attorney nor Solicitor-General, nor even
one of the King's Council, appeared against the
prisoners. Lastly, when two were convicted, one only
was executed; and I doubt very much whether even
he would have suffered, had it not appeared that a
capital indictment for burglary was likewise found by
the Grand Jury against him, and upon such evidence
as I think every impartial man must allow would have
convicted him (had he been tried) for felony at least."</p>

<p>There had been found on Penlez ten lace caps, four
laced handkerchiefs, three pairs of laced ruffles, two
laced clouts, five plain handkerchiefs, five plain aprons,
one laced apron, all the property of the wife of Peter
Wood. It was altogether false that Penlez was married.
Fielding says: "I hope I have said enough to
prove that the man who was made an example of
deserved his fate. Which, if he did, I think it will
follow that more hath been said and done in his favour
than ought to have been; and that the clamour of
severity against the Government hath been in the
highest degree unjustifiable. To say the truth, it
would be more difficult to justify the lenity used on
this occasion."</p>

<p>The case of Bosavern Penlez was the more hard
and open to criticism, in that, in the very same year,
there was a serious riot in the Haymarket Theatre,
when the Duke of Cumberland, a prince of the blood,
had drawn his sword, and leaping upon the stage, had
called on everybody to follow him. The people, ripe
for mischief, were too loyal to decline a prince's invitation.
The seats were smashed, the scenery torn down,
and the wreckage carried into the street, where a bonfire
was made of it; and but for the timely appearance
of the authorities the building itself would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
added to the fuel. For this, no one was hanged.
What was sauce for the goose was not sauce for the
gander.</p>

Walpole's <i>Memoirs of the Last Ten Years of George II</i>,

Magazine</i> for 1749.</p>

<h2>SAMUEL FOOTE</h2>


<p>This dramatic author and player was born at
Truro in the year 1721.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> His father, John
Foote, was a magistrate of the county of
Cornwall and commissioner of the Prize
office and Fine contract. He was well descended,
deriving from the family of Foote of Trelogorsick,
in Veryan, afterwards of Lambesso, in S. Clements,
acquired by bequest in the reign of Charles II.
The arms of the family were, <i>vert</i> a chevron
between three doves <i>argent</i>&mdash;the doves singularly
inappropriate as the cognizance of Samuel, as that
bird was deemed to be without gall. Bodannan,
in S. Enoder, was acquired by the Footes of Lambesso
by purchase. The family did not register its
arms and establish its pedigree at the visitation of the
Heralds in 1620, but that it was gentle admits of
no dispute. As no pedigree of the family has been
recorded, it is unknown who was the grandfather of
Samuel Foote, but possibly he may have been the
Samuel Foote of Tiverton whose daughter Elizabeth
married, 1691, Dennis Glyn of Cardinham, son
of Nicolas Glyn of Cardinham, M.P. for Bodmin and
Sheriff of Cornwall. Samuel's mother, descended in
the female line from the Earls of Rutland, was daughter
of Sir Edward Goodere, Bart., who had two surviving
brothers out of six&mdash;Sir John Dinely Goodere, Bart.,
and Samuel Goodere, captain of His Majesty's ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<i>Ruby</i>. A disagreement having arisen between the two
brothers, Sir John cut off the entail of his estates and
settled them on his sister's family. This widened the
breach, and the brothers had not spoken for years.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_360.png" id="i_360.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_360.png" alt="S. Foote" title="S. Foote" />
   <p class="caption2">S. Foote</p>
</div>

<p>Matters were in this train when, by accident, both
brothers met in Bristol in the January of 1741. Samuel
was then in command of his ship, lying in the roads.
Sir John was invited to dine with Mr. Jarrit Smith, an
attorney living on College Green, and the captain
called on this gentleman and requested permission to
be admitted to his table to meet his brother, whom he
had not seen for a very long time. Mr. Smith readily
acceded to this proposal, and was glad to have the
opportunity of apparently reconciling the brothers.
After dinner he left the room for an hour in order to
afford them a better opportunity of completing the
reconciliation. On his return he found them on the
most friendly terms. In this manner they parted at six
o'clock in the evening, the captain taking his leave
first. When some half an hour later Sir John quitted
the house, as he was passing the College Green Coffee-house,
on his way to his lodgings, he was fallen upon
by a party of the sailors of the <i>Ruby</i> and the <i>Vernon</i>
privateer, with Captain Goodere at their head; a cloak
was thrown over his head to muffle his cries for help,
and he was hurried to a boat, awaiting them in the
river, and conveyed thence on board the <i>Ruby</i>. When
there, they got him into the purser's cabin, and the
captain, by promises of ample reward, induced two of
his sailors, Matthew Mahony and Charles White, to
strangle him. In order to effect this the captain cut the
cord that attached his escritoire to the floor of the cabin,
and himself passed it round his brother's neck. Then,
drawing his sword, he stood sentinel at the door and
bade the two ruffians do their duty. Owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
struggles of Sir John and the nervousness of the men,
half an hour elapsed before the baronet was dead. At
last, when all was over, the captain deliberately walked
to his brother's body, held a candle over it to assure
himself that he was dead, and exclaimed, "Aye, this
will do; his business is now done."</p>

<p>Next day the circumstance of a gentleman having
been kidnapped on College Green induced Mr. Smith
to make inquiries; when, finding that the description
of the gentleman answered to the person of Sir John
Dinely Goodere, he entertained strong suspicions of
foul play shown by his brother, and he applied to the
mayor of Bristol for a warrant to search the <i>Ruby</i>.
This was granted, and there the baronet was found
strangled in the purser's cabin, and the captain already
secured by the first lieutenant and two of the men, who
had overheard the conference relative to the murder.</p>

<p>Captain Samuel Goodere and his two associates were
tried at the next assizes at Bristol on March 26th, 1741,
were found guilty of "wilful murder," and were hanged.</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Foote, deriving under the will of her
brother Sir John, became heiress to his estates.</p>

<p>John Foote had two sons by this lady, Samuel and
Edward. The first, the subject of this memoir, was
designed for the Bar; the second for the Church.
This latter was a feeble-minded man, who never
obtained preferment, dribbled away his fortune, and
was latterly in great distress, supported by the
liberality of his brother.</p>

<p>Foote was sent to school as a boy under the worthy Mr.
Conon, head-master of Truro Grammar School. There
he was initiated into Terence's plays, and in acting his
part excelled all his schoolfellows, and it was in consequence
of his success within this little circle that he
caught his first inspiration for the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the earliest instances of his jocularity, as
practised on his own father, is related by R. Polwhele
in his <i>Traditions and Recollections</i>. Imitating the
voice of Mr. Nicholas Donnithorne, from an inner
apartment where his father had supposed that gentleman
was sitting, he drew his father into conversation
on the subject of a family transaction between the two
old gentlemen, and thus possessed himself of a secret,
which, whilst it displayed his power of mimicry, justly
incurred his parent's displeasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Polwhele says: "Those (of the inhabitants of
Truro) are gone who used in his presence to arise
trembling with their mirth. Conscious of some oddnesses
in their appearance or character, they shrunk
from his sly observation. They knew that every
civility, every hospitable attention, could not save
them from his satire; and, after such experience,
they naturally avoided his company instead of courting
it. Foote, indeed, had no restraint upon himself, with
respect either to his conversation or his conduct. He
was, in every sense of the word, a libertine....
He was certainly a very unamiable character. Polly
Hicks, a pretty, silly, simpering girl, was dazzled by
his wit. She had some property; he therefore made
her his wife, but never treated her as such."</p>

<p>The father died soon after the establishment of his sons
in their several professions; but the mother lived to the
advanced age of eighty-four. W. Cooke says of her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had the pleasure of dining with her, in
company with a granddaughter of hers, at a barrister's
chambers in Gray's Inn, when she was at the age of
seventy-nine; and although she had full sixty steps
to ascend before she reached the drawing-room, she
did it without the help of a cane, and with all the
activity of a woman of forty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her manners and conversation were of the same
cast&mdash;witty, humorous, and convivial; and though her
remarks occasionally (considering her age and sex)
rather strayed beyond the limits of becoming mirth,
she, on the whole, delighted everybody, and was confessedly
the heroine of that day's party.</p>

<p>"She was likewise in face and person the very
model of her son Samuel&mdash;short, fat, and flabby, with
an eye that eternally gave the signal for mirth and
good humour; in short, she resembled him so much
in all her movements, and so strongly identified his
person and manners, that by changing habits they
might be thought to have interchanged sexes."</p>

<p>After leaving school Samuel Foote received his education
at Worcester College, Oxford, formerly Gloucester
Hall, which owed its refoundation and change of name
to Sir Thomas Cooke, Bart., a second cousin of Samuel.</p>

<p>The church connected with the college fronted a lane,
where cattle were sometimes turned out to graze during
the night, and the bell-rope hung very low in the middle
of the outside porch. Foote one night made a loop in
the cord and inserted a wisp of hay. One of the cows
smelling this seized it, and by tugging at the rope
made the bell ring, and continue to ring at jerky intervals
till the hay was consumed. This produced
consternation in the neighbourhood; people ran out of
their houses thinking that there must be a fire somewhere.
The same happened next and the following
nights, and it was concluded that the church was
haunted. But Dr. Gower, the then provost, and the
sexton sat up one night and watched, and discovered
that this was a prank of one of the scholars.</p>

<p>From the University Foote was removed to the
Temple, but the dryness of the law was not to his
taste, and he turned to the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>His first appearance was in the part of Othello at
the Haymarket Theatre, February 6th, 1747. But as
Macklin said on this occasion, "it was little better
than a total failure. Neither his figure, voice, nor
manners corresponded with the character; and in those
mixed passages of tenderness and rage the former was
expressed so whiningly, and the latter in a tone so
sharp and inharmonious, that the audience could scarcely
refrain from laughing."</p>

<p>Probably he speedily saw that his genius did not lie
in the direction of tragedy, and he soon struck out into
a new and untrodden path, in which he at once attained
the two great ends of affording entertainment to the
people and gaining emolument for himself. He opened
the Haymarket Theatre in the spring of 1747 with a
piece of his own writing, entitled <i>The Diversions of the
Morning</i>. This consisted of a mimicry of the best-known
men of the day&mdash;actors, doctors, lawyers, statesmen.
Had he contented himself with this he might
not have been interfered with, but to the piece of
mimicry he added the performance of popular farces&mdash;and
he had failed to procure a licence. To evade
this difficulty he announced his entertainment as a
Concert of Music, after which would be given <i>gratis</i>
his <i>Diversions</i> and a play.</p>

<p>The managers of the patent houses could not tolerate
such an infringement of their rights. They appealed
to the Westminster magistrates, and on the second
night the constables entered the theatre and dispersed
the audience.</p>

<p>But Foote was not so easily put down. The very
next morning he published the following statement in
the <i>General Advertiser</i>: "On Saturday afternoon,
exactly at twelve o'clock, at the New Theatre in the
Haymarket, Mr. Foote begs the favour of his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to come and drink a dish of chocolate with him, and
'tis hoped there will be a great deal of company and
some joyous spirits. He will endeavour to make the
morning as diverting as possible. Tickets to be had
for this entertainment at George's Coffee House, Temple
Bar, without which no one will be admitted. N.B.&mdash;Sir
Dilbury Diddle will be there, and Lady Betty Frisk
has absolutely promised." No one knew what this
advertisement meant, and a crowded house was the
natural result. When the curtain rose Foote came
forward and informed the audience that "as he was
training some young performers for the stage, he
would, with their permission, whilst chocolate was
getting ready, proceed with his instructions before
them." Then some young people, engaged for the
purpose, were brought upon the stage, and under the
pretence of instructing them in the art of acting, he
introduced his imitations.</p>

<p>As he was not interfered with, he changed the hour
to the evening and substituted tea for chocolate.</p>

<p>He mimicked Quin as a watchman, with deep,
sonorous voice calling out, "Past twelve o'clock, and
a cloudy morning"; Delane as a one-eyed beggar;
Peg Woffington as an orange girl, and imitated the
unpleasant squealing tone of her voice; Garrick in his
dying scenes, on which he prided himself.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, actors, who are peculiarly
sensitive to ridicule, were offended. When they appeared
in a grave play, as for instance, when Garrick
was dying on the stage, the audience laughed, recalling
what they had witnessed at the Haymarket. They
complained, "What is fun to you is death to us," but
Foote paid no regard to their remonstrances; he laughed
and pursued his course. He was perfectly unscrupulous,
wholly devoid of delicacy of feeling, and would turn his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
best friend and benefactor into ridicule in public. But
when, later, Weston took him off, he was highly incensed,
and bided his time to be revenged on him.</p>

<p>Next year Foote called his performance "An Auction
of Pictures." Here is one of his advertisements: "At
the forty-ninth day's sale at his auction rooms in the
Haymarket Mr. Foote will exhibit a choice collection
of pictures&mdash;some new lots, consisting of a poet, a
beau, a Frenchman, a miser, a taylor, a sot, two young
gentlemen, and a ghost. Two of which are originals,
the rest copies from the best masters." In this several
well-known characters were mimicked&mdash;Sir Thomas
Deveil, then the acting magistrate for Westminster,
Cook, the auctioneer, and orator Henley. To the
attractions of his "Auction," in ridicule of the Italian
Opera, he gave a "Cat Concert." The principal performer
in this was a man well known at the time by
the name of Cat Harris. Harris had attended several
rehearsals, where his <i>mewing</i> gave great satisfaction
to the manager and performers. However, on the last
rehearsal Harris was missing, and as nobody knew
where he lived, Shuter was deputed to find him, if
possible. He inquired in vain for some time; at last
he was informed that he lived in a certain court in the
Minories, but at which house he could not exactly
learn. Shuter entered the court and set up a cat solo,
which instantly roused his brother musician in his
garret, who answered him in the same tune. "Ho,
ho! Are you there, my friend?" said Shuter. "Come
along; the stage waits for you."</p>

<p>Fashion, as usual, flocked to the Haymarket to hear
and see its tastes turned into ridicule.</p>

<p>At the close of the season (1748) Foote was left a
considerable fortune by a relative of his mother, which
enabled him to move in all that luxury of dissipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
which was so congenial to his temper. Then he
departed suddenly for Paris and communicated with
none of his friends. Some supposed him to have been
killed in a duel, some that he had been hanged, some
that he had drunk himself to death. But he reappeared
in London at the close of the season of 1752, having
dissipated the fortune left him, but having enriched
his mind with studies made in France. He brought
with him a play he had composed, <i>The Englishman in
Paris</i>, which was brought out at Covent Garden
Theatre on March 24th, 1753, and it proved a success;
so much so, that Murphy, the dramatic author, wrote
a sequel to it, <i>The Englishman returned from Paris</i>,
which he had the frankness to show to Foote, who was
his friend. Foote, without a word, without asking
leave, appropriated the plot and characters, and turned
out a farce with the same title before Murphy had
placed his. Murphy was, naturally, highly offended,
and produced his play in another theatre, but without
great success, as Foote's play had already taken with
the public.</p>

<p>In the season of 1757 Foote produced at Drury Lane
his comedy of <i>The Author</i>, that principally turns on
the distresses incident to a writer dependent on his pen
for his daily bread, and on the caricature of a gentleman
of family and fortune, whom he entitled Cadwalader,
who appears ambitious to be thought a patron
of the arts and sciences, of which he is profoundly
ignorant. Cadwalader was a caricature of one of his
most intimate friends, a Mr. Ap Rice, a man of fortune
and education, and allied to many families of distinction.
At his table, where Foote was hospitably received,
in open and unguarded familiar discourse, Ap Rice
had laid himself open to ridicule. The Welsh gentleman
was stout, had a broad, unmeaning stare, a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
voice, and boisterous manner, and as he spoke his
head was continually turning to his left shoulder.
The farce was performed for several nights to crowded
audiences before Mr. Ap Rice felt the keenness of the
satire. At last the joke became so serious, that whenever
he went abroad, in the park, the coffee-house, or
the assembly, he heard himself spoken of as Cadwalader,
and pointed at with suppressed laughter, or
heard quotations from his part in the play: "This is
Becky, my dear Becky." Mightily offended, and
really hurt, he applied to Foote to have the piece suppressed.
But this Foote would not hear of&mdash;it was
drawing crowded houses. Then Ap Rice applied to
the Lord Chamberlain and obtained an injunction to
restrain the performance.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson was informed by a mutual friend that
Foote was going to produce an impersonation of
him on the stage. "What is the price of a cane?"
asked the doctor. "Sixpence." "Then," said he, "here
is a shilling; go and fetch me the stoutest you can
purchase, and tell Mr. Foote that at his first performance
I shall visit the theatre, go on the stage, and
thrash him soundly."</p>

<p>This was repeated to the mimic, and he deemed it
advisable to desist from <i>this</i> impersonation.</p>

<p>In <i>A Trip to Calais</i> he threatened to ridicule the
notorious Duchess of Kingston unless bought off. The
audacity of his personalities was astounding, where
he thought he could use his gift of mimicry without
being subject to chastisement. In the <i>Orators</i>, 1762,
he personated, under the name of Peter Paragraph,
a noted printer and publisher and alderman of Dublin,
known as One-legged Faulkener. The imitation was
perfect. The Irishman brought an action for libel
against him, and a trial ensued. But Nemesis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
another sort fell on him four years later. In 1766 he
was on a visit to Lord Mexborough, where he met the
Duke of York, Lord Delaval, and others, when some
of the party, wishing to have a little fun with Foote,
drew him into conversation on horsemanship, and the
comedian boasted "that although he generally preferred
the luxury of a post-chaise, he could ride as well
as most men he knew." He was urged to join that
morning in the chase, and was mounted on a high-spirited,
mettlesome horse belonging to the Duke of
York, that flung him as soon as he was in the saddle,
and his leg was so fractured that it had to be amputated,
and its place supplied by one of cork.</p>

<p>The Duke of York was not a little concerned at the
part he had taken in this practical joke, and to make
what amends he could obtained for him a royal patent
to erect a theatre in the city and liberties of Westminster,
from the 14th May to the 14th September,
during the term of his natural life. This was giving
him a fortune at one stroke, and Foote immediately
purchased the old premises in the Haymarket and
erected a new theatre on the same ground, which was
opened in the May following, 1767. He made considerable
profits, and lodged twelve hundred pounds
at his banker's and kept five hundred in cash.</p>

<p>But his usual demon of extravagance haunted him.
He went to Bath and fell in with a nest of gamblers,
who rapidly swindled him, not only out of his five
hundred, but also out of the sum he had placed with
his banker. Several of the frequenters of the rooms
saw that he was being cheated, and the Right Hon.
Richard Rigby, Paymaster of the Forces, took an
opportunity of telling him that he was being plundered,
"that from his careless manner of playing and betting,
and his habit of telling stories when he should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
minding his game, he must in the long run be ruined."
Foote, instead of taking this hint in good part,
answered angrily and so insultingly that Rigby withdrew.</p>

<p>When he had money he spent it in play and profligacy.
Three fortunes had been left him, and he
threw all away, and adopted as his motto, "Iterum,
iterum, iterumque."</p>

<p>His mother, as has been said, had inherited a large
fortune, but she had squandered it and was locked up
in the Fleet Prison for debt. Thence she wrote to her
son:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sam</span>,</p>

<p>"I am in prison for debt; come and assist your
loving mother,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">E. Foote</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To this brief note he replied:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p>"So am I; which prevents his duty being paid
to his loving mother by her affectionate son,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Sam. Foote</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When bringing out his comedy of <i>The Minor</i> considerable
objections were started to its being licensed,
and among other objectors was Secker, Archbishop of
Canterbury. Foote offered to submit the play to him
for revision, with permission to strike out whatever he
deemed objectionable. But the prelate was not to be
trapped thus. He knew well that had he done this,
Foote would have advertised its performance "as
altered and amended by his Grace the Archbishop of
Canterbury."</p>

<p>Having made a trip to Ireland, he was asked on his
return what impression was made on him by the Irish
peasantry, and replied that they gave him great satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
as they settled a question that had long agitated
his mind, and that was, what became of the cast clothes
of English beggars.</p>

<p>One evening at the coffee-house he was asked if he
had attended the funeral of a very intimate friend, the
son of a baker. "Oh yes, certainly," said he; "just
seen him shoved into the family oven."</p>

<p>Although he had on more than one occasion applied
to Garrick for loans of a few hundred pounds, this did
not deter him from mimicking Garrick, and when the
Shakespeare Jubilee took place at Stratford-on-Avon,
under the superintendence of this latter, Foote was so
jealous and envious of its success, that he schemed
bringing out a mock procession in imitation of it, with
a man dressed to resemble Garrick in the character of
the Steward of the Jubilee, with his wand, white-topped
gloves, and Shakespeare medal; whilst some
ragamuffin was to address him in the lines of the
Jubilee poet-laureate&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A nation's taste depends on you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a nation's virtue too;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to which the mimic Garrick was to reply by clapping
his arms, like the wings of a cock, and crowing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cock-a-doodle-doo!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was with difficulty that Foote could be deterred
from carrying his scheme into effect.</p>

<p>But, indeed, he spared no one. He had been separated
practically, though not legally, from his wife,
whom to his friends and acquaintances he spoke of as
"the Washerwoman." She was a quiet, inoffensive,
worthy woman; and his friends induced him after a
while to allow her to return to his house. As it chanced,
her conveyance was upset on the way, and she was
thrown out and much cut and bruised in her face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
person. Instead of sympathizing with her, he turned
the matter into joke with his boon companions, and
said, "If you want to see a map of the world, go and
look at my wife's face. There is the Black Sea in her
eye, the Red Sea in her gashes, and the Yellow Sea in
all her bruises."</p>

<p>Dining once with Earl Kelly at his house at North
End in the early part of the spring, his lordship, who
was a <i>bon vivant</i> and had a very red face, apologized
during dinner that he was unable to give the party
cucumbers that day, as none were ripe. "Your own
fault, my lord," said Foote. "Why didn't you thrust
your nose into the hot-house?"</p>

<p>On another occasion, Foote calling on the elder
Colman, the dramatist, heard him complain of want
of sleep. "Read one of your own plays," said
Foote.</p>

<p>Dining one day with Lord Stormont, he noticed the
diminutive size of the decanters and glasses. His
lordship boasted of the age of his wine. "Dear me,"
said Foote. "It is very little, considering its age."</p>

<p>A young parson was on his honeymoon. "I'll give
you a text for your next sermon," said Foote: "Grant
us thy peace so long as the moon endureth."</p>

<p>Some one asked Dr. Johnson whether he did not
think that Foote had a singular talent for exhibiting
character. "No, sir," replied the doctor. "It is not
a talent, it is a vice. It is what others abstain from.
His imitations are not like. He gives you something
different from himself, without going into other people.
He is like a painter who can draw the portrait of a man
who has a wen on his face. He can give you the wen,
but not the man."</p>

<p>In <i>The Mayor of Garratt</i> Foote took off and held
up to derision the old Duke of Newcastle, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
name of Matthew Mug. Of the Duke he was wont to
say that he always appeared as if he had lost an hour in
the morning and was looking for it all day. In <i>The
Patron</i> he satirized Lord Melcombe, but indeed there
were few with any peculiarity of manner or taste or
appearance, whom he was able to study, whom he did
not hold up to public ridicule.</p>

<p>The first time that George II attended the Haymarket
<i>The Mayor of Garratt</i> was on the stage. When His
Majesty arrived at the theatre, Foote, as manager,
hobbled to the stage door to receive him; but, as he
played in the first piece, instead of wearing the court
dress usual on these occasions, he was equipped in the
immense cocked hat, cumbrous boots, and all the other
military paraphernalia of Major Sturgeon. The
moment the King cast his eyes on this extraordinary
figure, as he stood bowing, stumping, and wriggling
with his wooden leg, George II receded in astonishment,
exclaiming to his attendants, "Look! Vat
is dat man&mdash;and to vat regiment does he belong?"
Even Samuel's not very bright brother came in for his
sneers. Edward Foote was fond of hanging about the
theatre, and frequented the green-room. Some one
asked Samuel who that man was. "He?" replied
Foote. "He's my barber." Somewhat later the relationship
came out, and the same person remarked to
him on his having spoken so contemptuously of
Edward. "Why," said Samuel, "I could not in conscience
say he was a brother-wit, so I set him down as
a brother-shaver."</p>

<p>Retribution came on him at last.</p>

<p>The reason why Foote did not produce his "take-off"
of the Duchess of Kingston as Lady Kitty Crocodile
has never transpired. According to one account, he had
threatened to caricature her in the hopes of levying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
blackmail on her to stop the production; according to
another, he received threats that made him fear for his
life, or at least a public horse-whipping, if he proceeded,
and he altered the character. But he was very angry,
and to be revenged he produced a piece, <i>The
Capuchin</i>, which was the original <i>Trip to Calais</i>
altered, but his satire was transferred from the Duchess
to her chaplain, named Jackson, whom he held up to
public scorn as Doctor Viper.</p>

<p>Jackson was furious, and trumped up a vile charge
against Foote, by the aid of a coachman whom the
actor had discharged from his service for misconduct.
Foote had made so many enemies that those whom he
had wounded and mortified found the money for a
prosecution; and the case was tried at King's Bench
before Lord Mansfield and a special jury. But it broke
down completely, and Foote was acquitted.</p>

<p>As soon as the trial was over, his fellow dramatist
Murphy took a coach and drove to Foote's house in
Suffolk Street, Charing Cross, to be the first messenger
of the good tidings.</p>

<p>Foote had been looking out of the window in
anxious expectation of such a message. Murphy, as
soon as he perceived him, waved his hat in token of
victory, and jumping out of the coach, ran upstairs, to
find Foote extended on the floor, in hysterics. In this
condition he continued for nearly an hour before he
could be recovered to any kind of recollection of
himself.</p>

<p>The charge, and the anxiety of the trial, broke his
heart; he never thoroughly rallied after it, and sold his
patent in the Haymarket Theatre to George Colman on
January 16th, 1777. By the terms of this agreement
Colman obliged himself to pay Foote an annuity of
sixteen hundred pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Having in some degree recovered his health, he was
advised by his physician to try the south of France
during the winter; and with this intent he reached
Dover on the 20th October, 1777, on his way to
Calais.</p>

<p>Whilst at Dover, he went into the kitchen of the inn
to order a particular dish for dinner, and the cook,
understanding that he was about to embark for France,
began to brag of her powers, and defy him to find any
better <i>cuisine</i> abroad, though, for her part, she said,
she had never crossed the water. "Why cookey,"
said Foote, "that cannot be, for above stairs they
informed me you have been several times <i>all over grease</i>
(Greece)." "They may say what they like," retorted
she, "but I was never ten miles from Dover in all my
life." "Nay, now," said Foote, "that must be a fib,
for I myself have seen you at <i>Spit-head</i>."</p>

<p>This was his last joke. Next morning he was seized
with a shivering fit whilst at breakfast, which increasing,
he was put to bed. Another fit succeeded that
lasted three hours. He then seemed inclined to sleep,
and presently with a deep sigh expired on October
21st, 1777, in the fifty-seventh year of his age. He was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The authors of the <i>Biographica Dramatica</i> say of
his farces "Mr. Foote's dramatic works are all to be
ranked among the <i>petites pièces</i> of the theatre, as he
never attempted anything which attained the bulk of
the more perfect drama. In the execution of them they
are sometimes loose, negligent, and unfinished, seeming
rather to be the hasty productions of a man of genius,
whose Pegasus, though endued with fire, has no inclination
for fatigue, than the laboured finishings of a
professed dramatist aiming at immortality. His plots
are somewhat irregular, and their catastrophes not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
always conclusive or perfectly wound up. Yet, with
all these little deficiencies, it must be confessed that
they contain more of one essential property of comedy,
viz. strong character, than the writings of any other
of our modern authors."</p>

<h2>THE LAST LORD MOHUN</h2>


<p>The first of the family of Mohun known to
history came over with the Conqueror from
Normandy, and received the name and title
of Sapell, Earl of Somerset. How the earldom
lapsed we do not know, but a Mohun next appears
as Baron of Dunster. Apparently, but not certainly,
the earldom was taken from them by Henry III, for
siding against him with the Barons in 1297. A branch
of the family settled at Boconnoc early in the fifteenth
century. In the church of Lanteglos by Fowey is a
brass of William Mohun, who died in 1508. Sir
Reginald Mohun, Knt., was sheriff of Cornwall in
1553 and 1560. He was squire of the body to Queen
Elizabeth, and his son, Sir William Mohun, was sheriff
in 1572 and 1578. His son, Sir Reginald, was created
baronet in 1612, and his grandson John was raised to
be Baron Mohun of Okehampton in 1628. Warwick,
the second Lord Mohun, died in 1665, leaving a son,
Charles, third Baron, who married Lady Philippa
Annesley, daughter of the Earl of Anglesea, and by her
had a son Charles, fourth Baron, and a daughter Elizabeth,
who died unmarried. He acted as second to Lord
Candish in a duel, where he was wounded in the belly
and died soon after; he was buried October 20th, 1677.</p>

<p>Charles, fourth Baron Mohun of Okehampton, was
married in the first place to Charlotte, daughter of
Thomas Mainwaring. With her he lived unhappily
and was separated from her, nor would he acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the daughter born to her as being his own child. He
had the good fortune, however, to be rid of her at last,
as she was drowned on a passage to Ireland with one of
her gallants. He married secondly Elizabeth, daughter
of Dr. Thomas Laurence, physician to Queen Anne, and
widow of Colonel Edward Griffith.</p>

   <p class="caption2"><i>Charles Mohun&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lord Mohun.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Fitton Gerrard, Earl of Macclesfield, maternal uncle
of his first wife, to make him some amends for his bad
bargain, left to Lord Mohun a good part of his estate.</p>

<p>Charles, fourth Baron Mohun, was of a contentious
nature, and was involved in several duels. He fought
Lord Kennedy on December 7th, 1692. On October
7th, 1694, a Mr. Scobell, a Cornish M.P., interfered
with Lord Mohun, who was attempting to kill a coachman
in Pall Mall. Mohun, furious at being interfered
with, cut Mr. Scobell over the head, and afterwards
challenged him. He was also engaged in a duel with
a Captain Bingham on April 7th, 1697, when he was
wounded in the hand. He was next engaged in a
quarrel with a Captain Hill of the Foot Guards, at
the Rummer Tavern on September 14th, 1697; he
managed to kill Hill.</p>

<p>The story of the murder of Mountford the actor by
Captain Hill, in which Lord Mohun was involved as
abetter, is given very fully by Sir Bernard Burke, in
his <i>Romance of the Aristocracy</i>, 1855, and I will here
condense his account.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bracegirdle was at the time a very charming
actress, with a delicious voice of remarkable flexibility,
and her singing of such a song as Eccles' "The bonny,
bonny breeze" brought down the house; but the mad
song, "I burn, my brain consumes to ashes," as sung
by her in the character of Marcella in <i>Don Quixote</i>,
was considered one of her masterpieces. Cibber
says that all the extravagance and frantic passion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Lee's <i>Alexander the Great</i> were excusable when Mrs.
Bracegirdle played Statira; that scarcely an audience
saw her that were not half her lovers without a
suspected favourite among them. In an age of general
dissoluteness she bore an immaculate reputation, and
the licentious men about town knew perfectly well that
she was beyond the reach of their solicitations. Mrs.
Bracegirdle had a friend, "a miracle of fine acting,"
Mrs. Mountford, also a performer at the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane, and became intimate with her. Some of
the malicious, who could ill believe that an actress was
virtuous, supposed that Mrs. Bracegirdle favoured that
lady's husband, who was a good actor of heroic
tragedy.</p>

<p>Among the many admirers of Mrs. Bracegirdle was
a Captain Richard Hill. So infatuated was he with
her charms, that he proposed to marry her; but, when
she rejected his offer, he regarded this as an insult,
and supposed that she had been persuaded by Mountford
to refuse him. Hill, in ungovernable wrath, vowed
that he would kill the actor who had dared to tender
advice to the beautiful Mrs. Bracegirdle to reject his
offer, and also to carry off his mistress by force.</p>

<p>At a supper, where were Lord Mohun, Captain Hill,
Colonel Tredenham, and a Mr. Powell, Hill spoke
openly of his purpose, and turning to Powell said, "I
am resolved to have the blood of Mountford." Powell,
who was a friend to both parties, took alarm at these
words, and replied that he should certainly inform
Mountford of the threat and caution him to be on his
guard. Captain Hill then drew off from him, and
approached Lord Mohun, whom he speedily discovered
to be ready to act as his ally.</p>

<p>Along with Mohun, Hill now seriously set about the
requisite preparations for carrying out his purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
which they agreed should take place the following
night. With this view, their first care was to order a
coach to be in waiting for them at nine o'clock in
Drury Lane, near the theatre; but, so as not to attract
particular notice, with two horses only, while a reserve
of four more was to be held in readiness at the stables,
to convey Hill and Mrs. Bracegirdle to Totteridge.
That they expected a serious resistance was apparent,
for they not only provided themselves with pistols, but
had bribed a party of soldiers to assist them in the
enterprise.</p>

<p>During the day the confederates dined together at a
tavern in Covent Garden, and talked openly of their
intention, before several other persons who were
present. But strangely enough, not a syllable reached
those interested, to give them timely warning. Yet
the conversation was of a nature to excite attention;
they discussed the scheme unreservedly, and Lord
Mohun remarked that the affair would cost at least fifty
pounds; to which Hill replied, "If that villain Mountford
resist I will stab him." "And I will stand your
friend if you do," observed Lord Mohun.</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that Mrs. Bracegirdle did
not play that night, and the confederates learned the
fact, as also that she was supping at the house of a
Mr. Page in Princes Street hard by, and thither, accordingly,
they repaired, planting themselves with the
soldiers over against a house occupied by Lord Craven.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock struck, and still no signs of her for
whom they were watching. They began to think that
they must have been misinformed and ordered the
coachman to drive to Howard Street, where Mrs.
Bracegirdle lodged, in the house of a Mrs. Browne.
Howard Street is a cross-way leading from Arundel
Street, through Norfolk Street, to Surrey Street, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
former of which lived Mountford, so that it was not
possible for the actor on his return from the theatre to
fail coming upon them. Here, however, they did not
remain long, their suspicions having been excited by
the appearance of several individuals pacing up and
down in front of the lady's lodgings, and these they
thought must be spies set to watch their proceedings.
They accordingly returned to their former station by
the house of Mr. Page. At ten o'clock the door opened
and that gentleman issued forth along with Mrs. Bracegirdle,
her mother and brother, and volunteered to
accompany them home, an offer they declined, as they
said that they needed no further protection; however,
he attended them part of the way. On coming up
Drury Lane they were surprised to see a crowd about
a coach drawn up before the house of Lord Craven,
with the steps down. In this Lord Mohun was seated,
with several cases of pistols near him. Before they
had time to inquire into the meaning of this, two of
the soldiers rushed forward, forced Mrs. Bracegirdle
away from Page, and would have dragged her to the
coach but that her mother clung about her neck, in
spite of some rough handling by the ruffians. Thereupon
up ran Hill, and he struck at both Page and the
old lady with his drawn sword; but some of the crowd
looking on interfered so effectually that he found himself
obliged to withdraw. However, he rallied, and
pretending that there was a disturbance and that the
lady was in danger and that she required safe conduct,
he so persuaded Mrs. Bracegirdle that he had no part
in the matter that she allowed him to escort her and
her mother to their home, and Lord Mohun and the
soldiers followed as though in pursuit, Hill occasionally
facing round as though to dare them to approach.</p>

<p>Upon reaching Howard Street the soldiers were dismissed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
as being no longer required, as it was now
deemed impossible to carry out the original plan of a
forcible abduction.</p>

<p>Just as Hill was about to withdraw, he plucked Page
by the sleeve, and intimated to him that he had a
desire to speak with him in private; but that gentleman,
who was eager to be back at his own house,
replied hastily that "another time would do; to-morrow
would serve."</p>

<p>However, no sooner was Mrs. Bracegirdle safe within
the house, than the others, fearing that evil might befall
Page, laid hold of him and drew him within, and
closed the door in the face of Captain Hill.</p>

<p>Instead of having his ardour cooled by his rebuff,
the captain became more wroth, and determined to
revenge himself on Mountford; and in conjunction
with Lord Mohun, he continued pacing up and down
the street for two mortal hours with his sword drawn.</p>

<p>Those within the house being greatly alarmed at
their proceedings, sent Mrs. Browne out to inquire the
reason of this. To this they replied, with the utmost
frankness, that they were awaiting the arrival of Mr.
Mountford. As evidence that the besiegers had no
intention of withdrawing, they sent for a couple of
bottles of wine, when the watch came up and asked
what they were doing in the streets at such an hour of
the night with drawn swords in their hands.</p>

<p>These inquiries were cut short at once by Lord
Mohun saying, "I am a peer of the realm; touch me
if you dare!" a reply that so staggered the watch
that they slunk away without further question. They
had, however, observed the waiter who brought the
wine and they followed him to the tavern to draw from
him an explanation they did not venture to demand
from a nobleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the besiegers were tipping off their wine, the
besieged found an opportunity for sending a messenger
to warn Mrs. Mountford of the danger threatening her
husband and to bid her communicate with him. Nor
was this the only one, a second and perhaps a third
were also despatched to caution him. But unhappily
every one of these messengers failed to reach him, and
at midnight he came along the street on his way homeward
without entertaining the least apprehension.</p>

<p>Lord Mohun was the first to meet and salute the
unhappy man, when the latter expressed his surprise at
finding his lordship there at such an hour.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have been sent for?" was the curt
reply. Mountford said, No&mdash;he was there on his way
home from the playhouse.</p>

<p>"You know all about the lady, I imagine," said Lord
Mohun.</p>

<p>Mountford not understanding the drift of his words
said, "I hope that my wife has given you no offence."</p>

<p>"You mistake me," said Lord Mohun; "it is Mrs.
Bracegirdle that I mean."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bracegirdle is no concern of mine," replied
Mountford; "but I hope your lordship does not
countenance any ill action of Mr. Hill."</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the impatient
captain, who suddenly started forward, and exclaiming,
"This is no longer the time for such discourses!"
struck Mountford with his left hand, and immediately
ran him through the body. The wounded man did not
fall to the ground at once; he had still, for a moment,
sufficient strength left to draw his sword, though not
to use it, when, exhausted by the effort, he sank upon
the ground.</p>

<p>A cry of murder arose, Hill fled, and the watch came
up now from the tavern where they had been questioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the drawer and imbibing. Mountford was carried
to his own lodgings, where he died, about one o'clock
in the afternoon of the same day, for it was some time
after midnight when the affair took place.</p>

<p>"The grand jury of Middlesex," says Macaulay,
"consisting of gentlemen of note, found a bill of
murder against Hill and Mohun. Hill escaped. Mohun
was taken. His mother threw herself at King William's
feet, but in vain. 'It was a cruel act,' said the King.
'I shall leave it to the law.'</p>

<p>"The trial came on in the Court of the Lord High
Steward, and, as Parliament happened to be sitting,
the culprit had the advantage of being judged by the
whole body of the peerage. There was then no lawyer
in the Upper House. It therefore became necessary,
for the first time since Buckhurst had pronounced
sentence on Essex and Southampton, that a peer
who had never made jurisprudence his special study
should preside over that grave tribunal. Caermarthen,
who, as Lord President, took precedence of all the
nobility, was appointed Lord High Steward. A full
report of the proceedings has come down to us. No
person, who carefully examines that report, and attends
to the opinion unanimously given by the judges in
answer to a question which Nottingham drew up, and
in which the facts brought out by the evidence are
stated with perfect fairness, can doubt that the crime of
murder was fully brought home to the prisoner. Such
was the opinion of the King, who was present during
the trial; and such was the almost unanimous opinion
of the public. Had the issue been tried by Holt and
twelve plain men at the Old Bailey, there can be no
doubt that a verdict of Guilty would have been returned.
The Peers, however, by sixty-nine votes to
fourteen, acquitted their accused brother. One great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
nobleman was so brutal and stupid as to say, 'After
all, the fellow was but a player; and players are
rogues.' All the newspapers, all the coffee-house
orators complained that the blood of the poor was shed
with impunity by the great. Wits remarked that the
only fair thing about the trial was the show of
ladies in the galleries. Letters and journals are still
extant in which men of all shades of opinion, Whigs,
Tories, Non-jurors, condemn the partiality of the
tribunal."</p>

<p>On the one hand, the words of the dying man exculpated
Mohun from any share in the actual murder; on the
other hand, it is clear from the uncontradicted testimony
of more than one witness, that he was fully cognizant
of Hill's intentions, and that he did not hesitate to
encourage him by his presence through the whole
affair. According to the Attorney-General, his first
question, when he surrendered himself, was, "Has
Mr. Hill escaped?" and, upon being answered in the
affirmative, he exclaimed, "I am glad of it! I should
not care if I were hanged for him," his only regret
being that Hill had escaped with very little money about
him. He confessed, moreover, to the watch, that he
had changed coats with his friend; the object, of
course, was to throw out the pursuers as much as
possible by this slight disguise.</p>

<p>This is Lord Mohun's portrait as drawn by a not unfavourable
hand: "Charles, Lord Mohun, is the representative
of a very ancient family, but he had the
misfortune to come to the title young, while the estate
was in decay; his quality introduced him into the best
company, but his wants very often led him into bad;
so that he became one of the arrantest rakes in town,
and, indeed, a scandal to the peerage; was generally
a sharer in all riots; and before he was twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
old was tried twice for murder by the House of Peers.
On his being acquitted at the last trial, he expressed
his contrition for the scandal he brought upon his
degree as peer by his behaviour, in very handsome
terms, and promised to behave himself so, for the
future, as not to give further scandal; and he has been
as good as his word; for now he applies himself in good
earnest to the knowledge of the constitution of his
country, and to serve it; and having a good deal of
fine and good sense, turned this way, makes him very
considerable in the House. He is brave in his person,
bold in his expressions, and rectifies, as fast as he can,
the slips of his youth, by acts of honesty, which he
now glories in more than he was formerly extravagant.
He was married, when very young, to a niece of my
Lord Macclesfield, who, dying without issue, left him
a considerable estate,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which he well improves. The
Queen continues him colonel of a regiment of foot.
He is of middle stature, inclining to fat, not thirty
years old."</p>

<p>However much he may have intended to amend, Lord
Mohun was again involved in a murder, that of a Mr.
Coote, a few years later, in conjunction with the Earl of
Warwick; he was, however, pronounced innocent by
the unanimous suffrage of the Peers.</p>

<p>After this last affair only was it that he amended his
ways, and the author of <i>The History of Queen Anne</i>,
March 11th, London, 1713, gives a favourable account
of him. "After this last misfortune my Lord Mohun
did wonderfully reclaim; and what by his reading, what
by his conversation with the ablest statesmen, so well
improved his natural parts, that he became a great ornament
to the peerage and a strenuous asserter of the cause
of Liberty, and the late Revolution: which last, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
could not but raise him many enemies; and is, I doubt,
the only reason why his memory is so unfairly, so barbarously
treated. 'Tis true, my Lord Mohun, like most
men in our cold climate, still lov'd a merry glass of wine
with his friends. But in this he was a happy reverse
to some men, who owe all their bright parts in the
management of affairs to the fumes of Burgundy and
Champaign: for he was exemplarily temperate when he
had any business of moment to attend. He behaved himself
so discretely at the Court of Hanover, whither he
accompanyed the late Earl of Macclesfield, whose niece
he had married, that he left an excellent character behind
him with the most serene Elector, and the Princess
Sophia, his mother, two allow'd judges of merit; and
when his Highness was to be install'd Knight of the
Garter he appointed the Lord Mohun to be his proxy."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Party feeling strongly coloured the descriptions given
of the character of Lord Mohun. He was a Whig and
zealous advocate of the claims of the Elector of Hanover,
and was consequently obnoxious to the Tories and
Jacobites. In the <i>Examiner</i> he is represented in the
worst light; and is even accused of cowardice; but
Bishop Burnet was able to say no more of him than
this: "I am sorry I cannot say so much good of him
as I wish; and I had too much kindness for him, to say
any evil unnecessarily."</p>

<p>In 1711 the attention of the legislature was drawn
to the subject of duels by Sir Peter King; and after
dwelling on the alarming increase of the practice,
obtained leave to bring in a Bill for the prevention
and punishment of duelling. It was read a first time on
May 11th, and was ordered for a second reading in the
ensuing week.</p>

<p>About the same time the attention of the Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
House was also drawn to the subject in a painful
manner. In a debate in the Lords upon the conduct
of the Duke of Ormond in refusing to hazard a general
engagement with the enemy, Earl Pawlet remarked
that nobody could doubt the courage of the Duke.
"He was not like a certain general, who led troops to the
slaughter, to cause great numbers of officers to be
knocked on the head in a battle, or against stone walls,
in order to fill his pockets by disposing of their
commissions."</p>

<p>That this was levelled at the Duke of Marlborough
no one doubted, but he remained silent, though evidently
suffering in mind. Soon after the House broke
up, the Earl Pawlet received a visit from Lord Mohun,
who told him that the Duke of Marlborough desired
some explanation of the words he had used, as certain
expressions employed by his lordship were greatly
offensive to him. He would accordingly be very glad
to meet him, and for that purpose desired him "to take
a little air in the country."</p>

<p>Earl Pawlet did not affect to misunderstand the hint,
but asked Lord Mohun in plain terms whether he
brought a challenge from the Duke. Lord Mohun
answered that he considered what he had said needed
no elucidation, and that he himself would accompany
the Duke of Marlborough as second.</p>

<p>He then took his leave, and Earl Pawlet returned
home and confided to his lady that he was going to
fight a duel with the Duke of Marlborough. The
Countess, greatly alarmed for her lord's safety, gave
notice of his intention to the Earl of Dartmouth, who
immediately, in the Queen's name, sent for the Duke of
Marlborough and commanded him not to stir abroad.
He also caused Earl Pawlet's house to be guarded by
two sentinels; and having taken these precautions, informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the Queen of the whole affair. Her Majesty
sent at once for the Duke, expressed her abhorrence of
the custom of duelling, and required his word of
honour that he would proceed no further. The Duke
pledged his word accordingly, and the affair terminated,
much, doubtless, to the disappointment of
Lord Mohun, who took a delight in these passages of
arms.</p>

<p>We come now to the last duel of Lord Mohun, in
which he lost his life and his title expired. The reader
will recall the description given of it in <i>Esmond</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke of Hamilton, a shuffling Jacobite, had
been in constant correspondence with the Court of
S. Germain's, and with the numerous agents of the Pretender
kept scattered about in various parts of the Continent
and in England. Even before Mrs. Masham and
Harley had undermined the Whig ministry, Hamilton
had been an acceptable visitor at the Court of
S. James's; but since the Tory party had got the
upper hand, he had been closeted far more frequently
with the Queen than before; and now he was appointed
to represent Queen Anne at the French Court. Burnet
says: "The Duke of Hamilton being now appointed
to go to the Court of France gave melancholy speculation
to those who thought him much in the Pretender's
interest; he was considered, not only in
Scotland, but here in England, as the head of his
party." A few days before he left for Versailles, his
career was cut short. He had been engaged in some
law-suits with Lord Mohun over the succession to the
estates of the Earl of Macclesfield, and this, together
with political animosity, inflamed both these noblemen
with deadly hatred towards each other. Mohun took
an occasion that offered of publicly insulting the Duke,
in the hope of making him the challenger. His Grace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
however, had too much contempt for the known character
of the man to enter into an idle dispute with him,
especially at a time when he was invested with the
sacred character of ambassador. He relied on his own
reputation with the world to bear him out in declining
to notice such an affront, offered at such a time, and
committed, as the Tories asserted, under the influence
of drink.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the insult were these. On Thursday,
November 13th, a party was assembled at the
chambers of Mr. Orlebar, a master in Chancery, when
the Duke made some reflections on Mr. Whitworth,
father of the Queen's late ambassador to the Czar;
whereat Lord Mohun roared out that the Duke had
neither truth nor justice in him. "Indeed, he has just
as much truth in him as your Grace!" The Duke of
Hamilton made no reply; and both parties remained at
the table for half an hour after this outbreak; and at
parting Hamilton made a low bow to Mohun, who
returned the civility, so that none of those there present
suspected any consequence from what had passed
between the two peers.</p>

<p>But Lord Mohun had determined to fight his private
and political adversary, and although he was the
offender he next day sent a challenge to the Duke by
the hand of a friend, General Maccartney. In the
evening of the 14th the Duke, accompanied by Colonel
John Hamilton, went to meet General Maccartney at
the Rose Tavern, in one room, whilst in the adjoining
Lord Mohun awaited Colonel Hamilton. Then and
there the time and place of the duel were agreed upon.
On Sunday morning, November 15th, at seven o'clock,
Lord Mohun with his second, General Maccartney,
went in a hackney-coach to the lodge of Hyde Park,
where they alighted, and were soon after met by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Duke of Hamilton and his second, Colonel Hamilton.
They all jumped over a ditch into a place called the
Nursery. It is said that Lord Mohun did not wish that
the seconds should bear a part in the engagement, but
the Duke insisted, saying that "Mr. Maccartney should
have a share in the dance." But the spirit of party so
completely seized hold of the subject as to make it
difficult to ascertain what were the real facts.</p>

<p>It is said on one side that the Duke was from the
first very unwilling to fight, and even at the last moment
would have consented to a reconciliation. According to
the evidence given by Colonel Hamilton at the inquiry
on November 25th, early in the morning of the 15th,
before he was half dressed, the Duke called at his house
and hurried him into his chariot "so soon that he
finished the buttoning of his waistcoat there. By the
time they had got into Pall Mall the Duke observed
that the Colonel had left his sword behind him; whereupon
he stopt his chariot and gave the footman a bunch
of keys and orders to fetch a mourning sword out of
such a closet. At the return of the footman they drove
on to Hyde Park, where the coachman stopt, and the
Duke ordered him to drive on to Kensington. When
they came to the lodge they saw a hackney-coach at a
distance, on which his Grace said, 'There was some
body he must speak with'; but driving up to it and seeing
nobody he asked the coachman, 'Where the gentlemen
were whom he had brought?' he answered 'A
little before.' The Duke and the Colonel got out in
the bottom and walked over the pond's head, where they
saw the Lord Mohun and General Maccartney before
them. As soon as the Duke came within hearing he said,
'He hop'd he was come time enough,' and Maccartney
answered, 'In very good time, my Lord.' After this
they all jumped over the ditch into the Nursery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the Duke turned to Maccartney and told him, 'Sir,
you are the cause of this, let the event be what it will.'
Maccartney said, 'We'll have our share.' Then the Duke
answered, 'There is my friend then, he will take his
share in my dance.'"</p>

   <p class="caption2">THE DUEL BETWEEN LORD MOHUN AND THE DUKE OF HAMILTON<br />
<i>From a contemporary mezzotint in the British Museum</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Duke is said to have looked about him and
remarked to his second, "How grey and cold London
looks this morning, and yet the sky is almost cloudless."
To which the Colonel replied, "It is through lack
of London smoke. London is nothing without its
smoke."</p>

<p>The combat then commenced between the principals,
and at a little distance from them between the seconds.</p>

<p>The combat between the former was carried on with
fury, and the clash of steel called to the spot the
keepers of the Park and a few stragglers who were
abroad there at this early hour&mdash;in all about nine or
ten. None of them interfered; they looked on as they
might at a cock-fight.</p>

<p>In a short time the Duke was wounded in both legs,
and his sword pierced his antagonist through the
groin, through the arm, and in sundry other parts
of the body. If they had thought little enough before
of attending to self-defence, they now seemed to
abandon the idea altogether. Each at the same
moment made a desperate lunge at the other; and
the Duke's weapon passed right through his adversary's
body up to the hilt. The latter, according to
one account, shortening his sword, plunged it into the
upper part of the Duke's left breast, the blade running
downwards into his belly. But there is another
version of the story.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the seconds had been engaged, and
Colonel Hamilton deposed: "Maccartney had made
a full pass at him, which he, parrying down with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
force, wounded himself in the instep; however, he
took that opportunity to close with and disarm
Maccartney, which being done, he turn'd his head,
and seeing my Lord Mohun fall, and the Duke upon
him, he ran to the Duke's assistance; and that he
might with the more ease help him, he flung down
both swords; and as he was raising my Lord Duke up,
he saw Maccartney make a push at his Grace"&mdash;this
was explained to be over his shoulder&mdash;and "he
immediately look'd to see if he had wounded him;
but seeing no blood, he took up his sword, expecting
Maccartney would attack him again; but he walked
off. Just as he was gone came up the keepers and
others, to the number of nine or ten, among the rest
Ferguson, my Lord Duke's steward, who had brought
Bassiere's man with him; who opening his Grace's
breast, soon discovered a wound on the left side, which
came in between the left shoulder and pap, and went
slantingly down through the midriff into his belly.
This wound is thought impracticable for my Lord
Mohun to give him."</p>

<p>Maccartney now took to his heels and fled, and
tarried not till he was secure in Holland.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton remained on the field, and surrendered
himself to arrest.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to remove the Duke to the
Cake House, but he expired on the grass. Lord
Mohun also died on the spot.</p>

<p>In <i>The Examiner</i>, the Tory mouthpiece, the story
is thus given: "The affront was wholly given by
Mohun, which the Duke, knowing him to be drunk,
did not resent. But the bravo Maccartney, who
depended for his support on the Lord Mohun, finding
his pupil's reputation very much blasted by those tame
submissions, which his Lordship, mistaking his man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
had lately paid to Mr. D'Avenant, judg'd there was no
way to set him right in the coffee houses and the Kit-Cat
but by a new quarrel, and made choice of the
Duke, a person of fifty-five, and very much weaken'd
by frequent attacks of gout. Maccartney was forc'd
to keep up his patron's courage with wine, till within
a few hours of their meeting in the field. And the
mortal wound which the Duke receiv'd, after his
adversary was run thro' the heart, as it is probably
conjectured, could not be given by any but Maccartney.
At least, nothing can be charged on him
which his character is not able to bear. 'Tis known
enough, that he made an offer to the late King to
murder a certain person who was under his Majesty's
displeasure; but that Prince disdain'd the motion, and
abhorred the proposer ever after. However it be, the
general opinion is that some very black circumstances
will appear in this tragedy, if a strict examination be
made; neither is it easy to account for three great
wounds in the Duke's legs, if he had fair play."</p>

<p>The sum of £800 was offered by the Government for
the apprehension of Maccartney.</p>

<p>Such would seem to be the facts, but the Colonel's
statement, when brought before the Council, was somewhat
rambling. In the excitement of the encounter he
was not in a condition to judge accurately what took
place. Cunningham, a Whig, says that Hamilton,
"being challenged to a duel by the Lord Mohun,
killed his antagonist; but was himself also killed, as
was supposed, by General Maccartney, Mohun's
second." Although the large sum mentioned was
offered for the apprehension of the General, he was
safe in the Low Countries. However, some years later
he returned to England and was tried, but the jury
gave a verdict of "Manslaughter" against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>A prodigious ferment was occasioned by the duel,
and party recriminations ran high. The stabbing of
the Duke to the heart rested mainly on the allegation
of Colonel Hamilton, but at the trial he prevaricated,
and several persons who had seen the combat at a
distance directly contradicted some material points of
his testimony.</p>

<p>Swift, in a letter to Mrs. Dingley on the day of the
duel, says: "This morning, at eight, my man brought
me word that the Duke Hamilton had fought with
Lord Mohun and killed him, and was brought home
wounded. I immediately sent him to the Duke's house,
in S. James's Square; but the porter could hardly
answer him for tears, and a great rabble was about the
house. In short, they fought at seven this morning.
The dog Mohun was killed on the spot; but while the
Duke was over him, Mohun, shortening his sword,
stabbed him in at the shoulder to the heart. The Duke
was helped towards the Cake House by the Ring in
Hyde Park (where they fought), and died on the grass,
before he could reach the house; and was brought
home in his coach by eight, while the poor Duchess
was asleep. I am told that a footman of Lord Mohun's
stabbed Duke Hamilton; and some say, Maccartney
did so too. Mohun gave the affront, and yet sent the
challenge. I am infinitely concerned for the poor
Duke, who was a frank, honest, good-natured man.
I loved him very well; and I think he loved me
better.... They have removed the poor Duchess to
a lodging in the neighbourhood, where I have been
with her two hours, and am just come away. I never
saw so melancholy a scene, for indeed all reasons of
real grief belong to her; nor is it possible for any one
to be a greater loser in all regards. She has moved
my very soul. The lodging was inconvenient; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
they would have removed her to another; but I would
not suffer it, because it had no room backwards, and
she must have been tortured with the noise of the
Grub Street screamers, singing her husband's murder
in her ears."</p>

<p>But in his <i>History of the Four Last Years of the
Queen</i>, written in 1713, Swift says: "The Duke was
preparing for his journey, when he was challenged to
a duel by the Lord Mohun, a person of infamous
character. He killed his adversary on the spot, though
he himself received a wound; and, weakened by the
loss of blood, as he was leaning in the arms of his
second, was most barbarously stabbed in the breast by
Lieutenant-General Maccartney. He died a few minutes
after in the field, and the murderer made his escape."</p>

<p>It is accordingly very doubtful whether the <i>coup de
grâce</i> was dealt by Lord Mohun or by his second.
With Lord Mohun, the barony of Mohun of Okehampton
became extinct; but the estate of Gawsworth, in
Cheshire, which he had inherited from Lord Macclesfield,
was vested by his will in his widow, and eventually
passed to her second daughter by her first husband,
Anne Griffith, wife of the Right Honourable William
Stanhope, from whom it passed to the Earls of Harrington.</p>

<p>Boconnoc and the Devon and Cornish estates were
sold in 1717 for £54,000 to Thomas Pitt, commonly
called Governor Pitt.</p>

<h2>THE LAST LORD CAMELFORD</h2>


<p>Thomas Pitt was the son of a tradesman
at Brentford, and he went to push his fortunes
in India as a merchant adventurer.
There he obtained a diamond, thought to be
the finest known, and with it returned to England,
where he offered it for sale to Queen Anne, and ultimately
sold it to the Regent Duke of Orleans, for the
French nation, for £135,000.</p>

<p>The Regent and his two successors in the government
of France set this diamond as an ornament in
their hats on occasions of state. It was stolen during
the disturbances of the Revolution, but was recovered,
and Napoleon had it placed between the teeth of a
crocodile, forming the handle of his sword.</p>

<p>With about half the large sum obtained by the sale
of the gem, Pitt purchased the property of the last
Lord Mohun in Cornwall, and settled at Boconnoc.
He also bought burgess tenures, giving the right of
franchise at Old Sarum, and represented that place in
Parliament. He had two sons, Robert and Thomas,
and Robert succeeded his father at Boconnoc. He
married Harriet Villiers, third sister of John, Earl
Grandison, and died in May, 1727, leaving two sons,
Thomas Pitt, and William, who was afterwards created
Earl of Chatham. Thomas Pitt, his brother, was
created Earl of Londonderry, in consequence of his
marrying the heiress of Ridgeway, in which family was
the earldom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Pitt, the eldest son of Robert, engaged in
political intrigue, and supported the party of Frederick,
Prince of Wales. He married Christiana, sister of
George, first Lord Lyttleton, by whom he had one son,
Thomas, who was created Baron Camelford in 1784,
when his first cousin William Pitt rose to be Prime
Minister. Thomas Pitt was aged twenty-five when he
became Baron Camelford, and he died in January, 1793,
leaving a son, Thomas Pitt, the second and last Lord
Camelford, and a daughter, married to William
Wyndham, Lord Grenville. Thomas Pitt, son of the
first baron, became an object of attention in Cornwall
almost from his birth.</p>

<p>On the event of his christening, in 1775, Boconnoc
was thrown open to the public, with general feasting
and revelries and wrestling. A silver bowl worth
fifteen guineas was the prize of the best wrestler, and
about fifty pounds were distributed among the disappointed
and defeated competitors.</p>

<p>The education of Thomas Pitt was conducted at
Boconnoc under a private tutor, but having paid a
visit to Plymouth at a time when naval preparations
were in full activity, he acquired a desire to go to sea.
However, he was sent to Berne to learn French and
German, and then to the Charter House. As he still
manifested a strong desire for the sea, he was admitted
to the Royal Navy as a midshipman, at the age of
fourteen; and he sailed in the <i>Guardian</i> frigate, commanded
by Captain Riou, laden with stores for the
colony of convicts at Botany Bay. The vessel became
a wreck, and the commander gave permission to such
of the crew as chose to avail themselves of it to take to
the boats and leave her. But Lord Camelford, together
with about ninety, resolved on abiding with the vessel,
with the captain, patching her up and navigating her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>After a perilous passage in the vessel to the Cape of
Good Hope, Lord Camelford, in September, 1790,
arrived at Harwich in the <i>Prince of Orange</i> packet.</p>

<p>Undaunted by the privations and hardships he had
undergone, he solicited an appointment on the voyage
of discovery conducted by Captain Vancouver. He
accompanied that officer, in the ship <i>Discovery</i>, during
part of his circumnavigation, but proved so troublesome,
headstrong, and disobedient to orders as to put
Captain Vancouver under the necessity of placing him
under arrest.</p>

<p>He accordingly quitted the <i>Discovery</i> in the Indian
Seas, and entered on board the <i>Resistance</i>, commanded
by Sir Edward Pakenham, by whom he was
appointed lieutenant.</p>

<p>During his absence at sea his father had died, and
when he returned to England it was to succeed to the
title and family estates. In October, 1796, he sent a
challenge to Captain Vancouver, who replied with
dignity that he had acted according to his duty, to
check insubordination and to preserve discipline. He
was, however, perfectly willing to submit his conduct
to the judgment of any flag officer in His Majesty's
Navy, and if the latter considered that he had overstepped
the bounds of what was right, then he would
be prepared to give Lord Camelford the satisfaction
he desired. But this proposal did not at all meet
Lord Camelford's views, and he wrote threatening the
captain with personal chastisement. Shortly after,
encountering him in Bond Street, he would have
struck him had not his brother interfered.</p>

<p>Having attained the rank of master and commander,
Lord Camelford was nominated to the command of the
<i>Favourite</i>, a sloop. That vessel and the <i>Perdrix</i> were
lying in harbour at Antigua on January 13th, 1790,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
when Captain Fahil, of the <i>Perdrix</i>, was absent on
shore, and had left the charge of the ship to the first
lieutenant, Mr. Peterson.</p>

<p>Lord Camelford then issued an order which Mr.
Peterson refused to obey, conceiving that his lordship
was exceeding his authority in giving a command to
the representative of a senior officer.</p>

<p>The two ships were hauled alongside of each other
in the dockyard to be repaired, and the companies of
each vessel collected round their respective officers on
the quay. High words ensued. Then twelve of the
crew of the <i>Perdrix</i> arrived on the spot, armed. Mr.
Peterson drew them up in line, and placed himself at
their head, with his sword brandished in his hand. Lord
Camelford at once called out his marines, and, rushing
off, borrowed a pistol from an officer of the dockyard,
and returning, in a threatening voice, asked Mr.
Peterson if he still refused obedience. "I do persist,"
replied the lieutenant. "You have no right to issue
the order." Thereupon Lord Camelford shot him
through the head, and he expired instantly. Lord
Camelford at once surrendered himself to Captain
Watson, of the <i>Beaver</i>, sloop. In this vessel Lord
Camelford was conveyed to Fort Royal, Martinique,
where a court-martial assembled on board the <i>Invincible</i>.
The court continued to sit from the 20th to
the 25th January, when they came to the decision
"that the very extraordinary and manifest disobedience
of Lieutenant Peterson to the lawful commands
of Lord Camelford, the senior officer at English
Harbour at that time, and the violent measures taken
by Lieutenant Peterson to resist the same, by arming
the <i>Perdrix's</i> ship's company, were acts of mutiny
highly injurious to his Majesty's service; the Court do
therefore unanimously adjudge that the said Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Camelford be honourably acquitted, and he is hereby
unanimously and honourably acquitted accordingly."</p>

<p>After this his lordship reassumed the command of
his ship, but for a short while only, for he threw up
his appointment and quitted the naval profession. His
personal appearance while in the service was marked
with eccentricity. His dress consisted of a lieutenant's
plain coat, without shoulder knots, and the buttons
green with verdigris. His head was closely shaved,
and he wore no wig over it, only an enormous gold-laced
cocked hat.</p>

<p>Not long after his return to England, a crazy notion
entered the head of Lord Camelford, that he would
go to Paris and assassinate some, if not all, of the
Directory. Accordingly, on the night of Friday, 18th
January, 1799, he proceeded by coach to Dover, where
he arrived on the following morning, and put up at
the City of London Inn. After breakfast he walked on
the pier, and engaged a boat to convey him to Deal.
He came to terms with a boatman named Adams, and
then confided to him that he desired to be conveyed
not to Deal but to Calais, where he purposed disposing
of some watches and other trinkets, and finally bargained
with him to be put across for twelve guineas.
But his lordship's conduct and manner of speech were
so odd, that Adams deemed it advisable to speak of
the matter to Mr. Newport, the collector. Newport
advised that Adams and his brother should keep the
appointment, which was for six o'clock that evening,
when he would be there and investigate the affair.
Accordingly, when Lord Camelford entered the boat,
he was arrested, and required to go with Newport to
the Secretary of State's office in London. They found
on him, when taken, a brace of pistols and a long, two-edged
dagger. On Saturday, the 18th January, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
eleven at night, he was put in a post-chaise, and
escorted by Newport and the two Adamses to the Duke
of Portland's office, where he was recognized. A
Privy Council was at once summoned, and Mr. Pitt
despatched a messenger to Lord Camelford's brother-in-law,
Lord Grenville, to come at once to town. His
lordship was examined along with Newport and the
two Adamses, and the Council, satisfied that he was
crazy, discharged him.</p>

<p>Not long after this, he brought notice upon himself
in another sort of matter. On the night of the 2nd
April, 1799, during the representation of the farce <i>The
Devil to Pay</i>, at Drury Lane Theatre, a riot took place
in the box-lobby, occasioned by the entrance of some
gentlemen in a state of intoxication, who began to
demolish the chandeliers, when Lord Camelford, as
one of the ringleaders, was taken into custody, charged
by a Mr. Humphries with having knocked him down
repeatedly and nearly beaten out one of his eyes.
For this he was sued at the Court of King's Bench, and
was condemned to pay £500.</p>

<p>In town Lord Camelford was incessantly embroiled
with the watchmen, and was either had up before the
magistrates, or else obliged to bribe the constables to
let him off. He was a terror and a nuisance to quiet
citizens passing through the streets at night.</p>

<p>In 1801, when the return of peace was celebrated by
a general illumination, no persuasions of his landlord,
a grocer in New Bond Street, could induce him to
have lights placed in the windows of his apartments.</p>

<p>Consequently the mob assailed the house and
smashed every pane of glass in his windows. Whereupon
his lordship sallied forth, armed with a cudgel,
and fell on the rabble, and was severely mauled by it,
rolled in the kennel, much beaten, and his clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
torn off his back. As the illuminations were to be
continued on succeeding nights, he hired a party of
sailors to defend his house.</p>

<p>One evening he entered a coffee-house in Conduit
Street in shabby costume, and sat down to peruse the
paper. Shortly after a buck of the first water came
up, threw himself into the box opposite, and shouted
to the waiter to bring him a pint of Madeira and a
couple of wax candles. Till these arrived he coolly
took to himself Lord Camelford's candle, set himself
to read.</p>

<p>Lord Camelford shouted to the waiter to fetch him
a pair of snuffers, and then walking into the fop's box
extinguished his candle.</p>

<p>Boiling with rage, the indignant beau roared out,
"Waiter! waiter! who the deuce is that fellow who
has insulted me?"</p>

<p>The waiter, coming up with the pint of Madeira and
the desired candles, replied, "Lord Camelford, sir."</p>

<p>"Lord Camelford!" shouted the dandy, jumped up,
threw down his money, and bolted without having
tasted his Madeira.</p>

<p>For some time Lord Camelford had been acquainted
with a Mrs. Simmons, who had formerly lived under the
protection of a Mr. Best, a friend of his lordship. Some
mutual acquaintance told him that Best had said something
slighting of him to this woman. This so exasperated
Lord Camelford that on March 6th, 1804, meeting
Mr. Best in the Prince of Wales's Coffee-house, he
went up to him and said in threatening tones: "I find,
sir, that you have spoken of me in most unwarrantable
terms." Mr. Best replied that he was quite unconscious
of having done so. Lord Camelford, then speaking
loud enough for every one present to hear, declared
that he knew well enough what Best had said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Mrs. Simmons, and that he esteemed him, Best, to be
"a scoundrel, a liar, and a ruffian."</p>

<p>Best could do no other than send him a challenge,
but with it an assurance that his lordship had been
misinformed, as no such words had ever passed his
lips. He expected, accordingly, that Lord Camelford
would acknowledge his mistake, and then all would
be as before. But Lord Camelford would listen to no
explanation, and a meeting was appointed to take place
the following morning.</p>

<p>Lord Camelford went to his lodgings in Bond Street,
and there wrote his will, and added to it the following
declaration: "There are many other matters, which
at another time I might be inclined to mention, but
I will say nothing more at present than that in the
present contest I am fully and entirely the aggressor,
as well in the spirit as in the letter of the word. Should
I, therefore, lose my life in a contest of my own seeking,
I most solemnly forbid any of my friends or
relations, let them be of whatsoever description they
may, from instituting any vexatious proceedings
against my antagonist; and should, notwithstanding
the above declaration on my part, the laws of the land
be put in force against him, I desire that this part
of my will may be made known to the King, in order
that his royal heart may be moved to extend his mercy
towards him."</p>

<p>From this it would appear that Lord Camelford
was convinced that he had made a mistake, and no
longer believed that Best had used the expressions
attributed to him. At the same time he was too proud
to admit that he had been mistaken, and submit to
make a public apology.</p>

<p>His lordship quitted his lodgings between one and
two on the morning of Wednesday, the 7th March, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
slept at a tavern, with a view to avoid the officers of the
police, should they get wind of the proposed meeting
and prevent it.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the appointment made by the seconds,
Lord Camelford and Mr. Best met early in the morning
at a coffee-house in Oxford Street, and here again
Mr. Best made an attempt at a reconciliation, and
renewed the assurance that he never had uttered the
words reported to have been said by him. "Camelford,"
said he, "we have been friends, and I know the
unsuspecting generosity of your nature. Upon my
honour, you have been imposed upon by a strumpet.
Do not insist on prosecuting a quarrel in which one of
us must fall."</p>

<p>To this Lord Camelford replied, "Best, this is child's
play! the thing must go on."</p>

<p>Mr. Best was esteemed the best shot in England, and
his lordship dreaded, should he retract the offensive
words used by himself at the coffee-house, that
malicious folk might say he did it out of fear.
Accordingly his lordship and Mr. Best, on horseback,
took the road to Kensington, followed by a post-chaise,
in which were the two seconds. On their arrival at the
"Horse and Groom," about a quarter to eight, the
parties dismounted, and proceeded along the path
leading to the fields behind Holland House. The
seconds measured the ground, and they took their
station at the distance of thirty paces. Lord Camelford
fired first, but missed his aim. A space of some
seconds intervened, and then Best fired; whereupon
Lord Camelford fell.</p>

<p>The seconds, together with Mr. Best, at once ran to
his assistance, when he is said to have grasped the
hand of his antagonist, and to have said, "Best, I am a
dead man; you have killed me, but I freely forgive you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>The report of the pistols had attracted attention, and
several persons were seen running up, whereupon Best
and his second got into the post-chaise and drove off at
a gallop.</p>

<p>One of Lord Holland's gardeners now approached,
and Lord Camelford's second ran to summon a
surgeon, Mr. Thompson, of Kensington, and bring
him to the spot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gardener hallooed to his fellows to
stop the post-chaise; but the dying man interposed,
saying "that he did not wish them to be arrested; he
was himself the aggressor, and he forgave the gentleman
as he trusted that God would forgive him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile a sedan-chair was procured, and his lordship
was conveyed to Little Holland House, the
residence of a Mr. Ottey, and a messenger was despatched
to the Rev. W. Cockburne, Lord Camelford's
cousin, to inform him as to what had taken place.
That gentleman at once communicated with the police,
and then hurried to his noble relative. By this time
others had arrived, Mr. Knight, the domestic surgeon
of his lordship, and his most intimate friend, Captain
Barrie. The wound was examined, and was pronounced
to be mortal.</p>

<p>Lord Camelford continued in agonies of pain during
the whole day, when laudanum was administered, and
he was able to obtain some sleep during the night, so
that in the morning he felt easier.</p>

<p>During the second day his spirits revived, and he
conversed with those about his bed. The surgeons,
however, could not give the smallest hope of recovery.
To the Rev. W. Cockburne, who remained with him till
he expired, his lordship expressed his confidence in the
mercy of God; and he said that he received much
comfort from the reflection that he felt no ill-will against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
any man. In the moments of his greatest pain he cried
out that he trusted the sufferings he endured might be
accepted as some expiation for the crimes of his life.</p>

<p>He lingered, free from acute pain, from Thursday
till Saturday evening, about half-past eight, when
mortification set in and he breathed his last.</p>

<p>On the evening of his decease an inquest was held
on the body, and a verdict of wilful murder returned
against "some person or persons unknown."</p>

<p>Thereupon a bill of indictment was preferred against
Mr. Best and his second, but this was ignored by the
grand jury.</p>

<p>As Thomas, the second Baron Camelford, died without
issue, Boconnoc passed to his sister, Lady Grenville.</p>

<p>A life of Lord Camelford, with portrait, was published
in London (Mace, New Russell Court, Strand),
1804.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Cockburne also wrote <i>An Authentic
Account of the late Unfortunate Death of Lord Camelford</i>,
London (J. Hatchard), 1804. As in this he animadverted
on the negligence of the magistrates in not
preventing the duel, Mr. Cockburne was answered by
one of them, Philip New, in <i>A Letter to the Rev. Wm.
Cockburne</i>, London (J. Ginger, Piccadilly), 1804.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM NOYE</h2>


<p>Cornwall has no great cause to boast of
William Noye as her son. He was undoubtedly
a shrewd, subtle, and learned
lawyer; but he was wholly without principle
and consistency.</p>

<p>He was the son of Edward Noye, of Carnanton, in
Mawgan parish, and grandson of William Noy, or
Noye, of Pendrea, in Buryan. He was born at this
latter place, it is asserted, in 1577. In 1593 he entered
Exeter College, Oxford, and thence removed to Lincoln's
Inn to study common law. He represented
Grampound in Parliament 1603-14, Fowey 1623-5,
S. Ives 1625-7, Helston 1627-31. In Parliament he
proved himself an able and determined opponent to the
encroachment of the Royal prerogative. Hals says:
"In the beginning of the reyne of King Charles I he
was specially famous for beinge one of the boldest and
stoutest champions of the subjects' liberty in Parliament
that the western parts of England afforded; which
beinge observed by the Court party, Kinge Charles
was advised by his Cabinet Councill that it wold be a
prudent course to divert the force and power of Noye's
skill, logick, and rhetorique another waye, by givinge
him som Court preferment. Whereupon Kinge
Charles made him his Attorney-General, 1631, by
which expedient he was soon metamorphized from an
asserter of the subjects' liberty and property to a most
zealous and violent promoter of the despotick and arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
prerogative or monarchy of his Prince; soe that
like the image of Janus at Rome, he looked forward
and backward, and by means thereof greatly enriched
himself.&mdash;Amongst other things, he is reflected upon by
our chronologers for beinge the principal contriver of
the ship-money tax, layd by Kinge Charles upon his
subjects for settinge forth a navye, or fleet of shipps at
sea, without the consent of Lords or Commons in
Parliament, which moneys were raysed by writt of the
sheriffs of all countys and commissioners, and for a
long tyme brought into the exchequer twenty thousand
pound per mensem, to the greate distast of the Parliament,
the layety, and clergye, who declard against it as
an unlawfull tax."</p>

<p>Noye's appointment as Attorney-General was on
October 27th, 1631. He was not the only one who was
a turncoat. Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards
created Earl of Strafford, Sir Dudley Digges, and
Littleton also apostatized. Wentworth, the most renowned
of the set, after being one of the sturdiest of the
reformers and boldest declaimers in the House of
Commons&mdash;after suffering imprisonment for refusing
to contribute to the forced loan&mdash;this eminent person, a
gentleman of Yorkshire, who boasted his descent, by
bastardy, from the royal line of the Plantagenets, out of
a very ignoble rivalry and an ambition for rank and
title (even his friends could discover no purer motives),
sold himself body and soul to the Court. Sir Dudley
Digges, though a spirited debater and a man of talent,
had been known for some time to be without principle,
and, upon being offered the post of Master of the Rolls,
he closed at once with the bargain and turned round
upon his former friends.</p>

<p>Noye and Littleton were both distinguished lawyers.
Noye's <i>Treatise of the Principall Grounds and Maximes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<i>of the Laws of this Kingdom</i> has gone through numerous
editions down to 1870. His <i>Compleat Lawyer</i> has
also been republished frequently. Noye as Attorney-General,
and Littleton as Solicitor-General, now used
their wits and their knowledge to explain and stretch
the prerogative, and they did this apparently without a
blush at the recollection of their previous conduct
when they had combated for the rights of Parliament
and the liberties of the people.</p>

   <p class="caption2">S.<sup>ir</sup> WILLIAM NOY Atturney Generall to King CHARLES the First</p>
</div>

<p>Among Howell's <i>Familiar Letters</i> is one to Sir
Arthur Ingram at York. "Our greatest news here
now is, that we have a new Attorney-General, which is
news indeed, considering the humour of the man, how
he hath been always ready to entertain any cause
whereby he might clash with the Prerogative: but now
Judg Richardson told him, his head full of Proclamations
and Decrees, how to bring money into the
Exchequer. He hath lately found out amongst the old
records of the Tower some precedents for raising a tax
called Ship-Money in all the Port-Towns when the
kingdom is in danger. Whether we are in danger or
no, at present 'twere presumption in me to judg."</p>

<p>That England needed a fleet to protect her could
not be disputed. Howell admits as much. "One with
half an eye may see we cannot be secure while such
large fleets of men-of-war, both Spanish, French,
Dutch, and Dunkirkers, some of them laden with ammunition,
men, arms, and armies, do daily sail on our
seas and confront the King's chambers (guns), while
we have only three or four ships abroad to guard our
coast and kingdom, and to preserve the fairest flower of
the crown, the dominion of the Narrow Sea, which I
hear the French Cardinal begins to question, and the
Hollander lately would not vail to one of His Majesties
ships that brought over the Duke of Lenox and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Lord Weston from Bullen (Boulogne); and indeed we
are jeer'd abroad that we send no more ships to guard
our seas."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Dunkirk was peculiarly obnoxious, as it was a nest of
pirates that fell on our small trading vessels, and even
Algerines came with impunity to our coasts and carried
off captives as slaves in Africa. The Dutch, taking
advantage of the domestic broils in England, had greatly
advanced their commerce, and were prepared to dispute
with England the command of the Channel. They
excluded English vessels from the northern fisheries,
and went so far as to claim and to exercise the right
of fishing along the English coasts. The Navy of
France, moreover, was also rapidly augmented, under
the fostering care of Richelieu.</p>

<p>Hitherto the ports on the coast had contributed
towards the defence of the land and the protection of
our shipping, but the inland towns had been exempted.
This was not reasonable, and Charles resolved on
imposing a general tax to provide England with a fleet.
He had recourse to Noye instead of placing the matter
before Parliament.</p>

<p>Noye, says Clarendon, "was wrought upon by
degrees by the great persons that steered the public
affairs to be an instrument in all their designs, turning
his learning and industry to the discovery of sources of
revenue, and to the justifying them when found&mdash;thinking
that he could not give a clearer testimony that
his knowledge of the law was greater than all other
men's, than by making that law which all other men
believed to be not so. So he moulded, framed, and pursued
the odious and crying project of soap, and with his
own hand drew and prepared the writ for ship-money,
both which will be lasting monuments of his fame."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<p>About the soap monopoly presently.</p>

<p>The first writ was issued by the Lords of the Council
"for the assessing and levying of the ship-money
against this next spring," on the 20th October, 1634.
It was signed by the King, and was addressed to the
mayor, commonalty and citizens of London, and to the
sheriffs and good men in the said city and in the liberties
thereof. They were commanded by the 1st March to
provide one ship of war of 900 tons with 350 men at
the least, one other ship of war of 800 tons and 260
men at the least, four other ships of war of 500 tons
with 200 men in each, and another ship of war of 300
tons with 150 men. They were further ordered to supply
those ships with guns, powder, and all necessary
arms, with double tackling, provisions, and stores; as
also to defray at their charges the men's wages for
twenty-six weeks. The Common Council remonstrated,
declaring that by their ancient liberties they ought to
be free from any such burden; but the Privy Council
rejected the remonstrance, and compelled submission.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the following year, 1635, the
writs, after having been served along the sea-board,
were sent to the inland counties, but from them money
was asked in lieu of ships at the rate of £3300 for
every ship, and the local magistrates were empowered
to assess all the inhabitants for a contribution.</p>

<p>In spite of the resistance offered to the exaction of
this tax in 1635 and the following year a fleet was
raised, the Dutch fishing vessels were driven from the
coast, and a number of English slaves were rescued
from Moorish pirates.</p>

<p>Howell wrote to Mr. Philip Warwick in Paris:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
"The greatest news we have here is that we have a
gallant Fleet Royal ready to set to sea for the security
of our Coasts and Commerce, and for the sovereignty of
our seas. Hans (the Hanseatic League) said the King
of England was asleep all the while, but now he is
awake. Nor, do I hear, doth your French Cardinal
tamper any longer with our King's title and right to
the dominion of the Narrow Seas. These are brave
fruits of the Ship-Money."</p>

<p>The King was still in great straits for money, and
he turned for help to Noye. The Parliament had insisted
on the suppression of monopolies, but Charles
revived them by Noye's advice; and for the sum of
£10,000 which they paid for their patent, and for a
duty of £8 upon every ton of soap they should make,
he granted to a company a charter according to it the
exclusive privilege to make and to sell soap. The
patent had a proviso in it permitting every soap-boiler
then exercising his trade in England to become a member
of the chartered company; and that precious turncoat,
Noye, who devised the project, considered that in
this way he had evaded the letter of the law, as the
Act of Parliament forbidding monopolies had been
directed against individuals and against some two or
three monopolists favoured by the Court. These incorporated
soap-boilers, as part of their bargains,
received powers to appoint searchers; and they exercised
a sort of inquisition over the trade. Such dealers
as resisted their interference, or tried to make soap on
their own account, were handed over to the tender
mercies of the Star Chamber.</p>

<p>This precedent was followed by the creation of a
similar company of starch-makers.</p>

<p>The King and Laud, who had been promised the
primacy on the death of Archbishop Abbot, were embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
together on an evil course. Laud believed in
the Divine Right of Kings, and he was a man totally
devoid of suavity of manner and of breadth of mind.
He would compel all men to think as he thought, and
act as he chose. That wheat and tares should grow
together till the harvest was a doctrine of the Gospel
he could not comprehend, and his energies and power
were directed towards the forcible uprooting of the
tares in the field of the Church, and the tares were the
heterodox Puritans. Between him and the King they
would allow no liberty to men either in their bodies
and goods, or in their souls and consciences. That
there should be crabbed and crooked sticks Laud would
not allow; all must be clean and straight as willow
wands. To the civil despotism alone as exercised by
Charles, the English people might possibly have submitted
for some time longer, for the ship-money had
produced the desired effect; but the scourge of Laud
lashed them to fury. And Noye was the scourge Laud
employed in the Star Chamber. Hammon Le Strange,
in his <i>Life of King Charles I</i>, says that Noye became
so servilely addicted to the King's prerogative, by
ferreting out old penal statutes and devising new exactions,
that he was the most pestilential vexation of the
subject that the age produced.</p>

<p>When William Prynne, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn,
was brought (1634) before the Star Chamber to answer
for his book <i>Histrio-Mastix, or the Players' Scourge</i>,
it was Noye who filed information against him. Prynne
attacked all plays, masques, and dances. The offence
charged against him was this: "Although he knew that
His Majesty's royal Queen, the Lords of the Council,
etc. were in festivals oftentimes present spectators of
some masques and dances, and many recreations that
were tolerable and in themselves sinless, and so declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
to be by a book printed in the time of His
Majesty's royal father; yet Mr. Prynne, in his book,
hath railed not only against stage-plays, comedies,
dancings, and all other exercises of the people, and
against all such as frequent or behold them; but
further, in particular, against hunting, public festivals,
Christmas-keeping, bond-fires, and May-poles; nay,
even against the dressing up of houses with green
ivy." He was further accused of directly casting
aspersions upon the Queen, and of stirring up the
people to discontent against the King, whom he had
spoken of in "terms unfit for so sacred a person."</p>

<p>The whole tenor of the book, according to Noye,
was not less against the Church of England than
against these amusements, and their Sacred Majesties
for countenancing them. "The music in the Church,"
said the Attorney-General, "the charitable terms he
giveth it is, not to be a noise of men, but rather a
bleating of bruit beasts; choristers bellow the tenor as
it were oxen, bark a counter-point as a kennel of dogs,
roar out a treble like a sort of bulls, grunt out a bass
as it were a number of hogs ... also his general censure
of all the bishops and of all the clergy; they scorn
to feed the poor&mdash;these silk and satin divines. Very
charitable terms upon those of the Church. Christmas,
as it is kept, is a devil's Christmas&mdash;nay, he doth bestow
a great number of pages to make men affect the name
of Puritan, as though Christ were a Puritan, and so he
saith in his Index."</p>

<p>The fact was Prynne was a narrow-minded, cantankerous
fanatic, whose only idea of religion was of
an acrid nature, and who looked upon all entertainments
as wicked. He complained that forty thousand
playbooks had been sold in London, and that there
was no keen demand for printed sermons; that Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Jonson's plays and poems had been published on better
paper than Bibles.</p>

<p>Instead of treating Prynne, as a religious maniac,
with good-humoured contempt, he was sentenced by
the Star Chamber to pay £10,000, be branded on the
forehead, have his nostril slit, and his ears cropped.
This infamous sentence was executed, and then Prynne
was sent to the Fleet, where he was to endure imprisonment
till he retracted and apologized. So far
from apologizing, he sent from the Fleet to Laud a
stinging letter about the Star Chamber sentences,
which letter Laud showed to the King, and then, by
the King's command, showed it to Noye. Noye had
Prynne forthwith brought to his chamber, exhibited the
letter, and asked him whether he acknowledged his
handwriting. Prynne replied that he could not tell
unless he were allowed a close inspection of it. The
letter being then placed in his hands, and Mr. Attorney
Noye having retired to his closet for a pressing necessity,
Prynne, when his back was turned, tore it to
shreds and threw the scraps out of the window. Noye
then brought Prynne again before the Star Chamber,
but Laud now interfered, and urged that the matter of
the insulting letter might not be pressed against him.</p>

<p>In 1636, as soon as he could get hold of ink and
paper, this incorrigible pamphleteer published fresh
attacks on the bishops, among others <i>News from
Ipswich</i>, under the name of Matthew White. He
was again dragged before the Star Chamber, and was
fined £5000 and ordered to lose the rest of his ears,
to be branded on both cheeks with "S. L." for "Seditious
Libeller." Noye, however, had no part in this
final persecution; nor did he live to see the results to
the King of the course he had recommended and which
had been pursued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>His health began to fail, and he went to Tunbridge
Wells to drink the waters. They, however, did him no
good, and he died on the 9th August, 1635, at the
Wells, and was buried in New Brentford Church on
the ensuing 11th August.</p>

<p>Howell, in a letter to Viscount Savage dated 1st
October, 1635, wrote: "The old steward of your
Courts, Master Attorney-General Noy, is lately dead,
nor could Tunbridge Waters do him any good.
Though he had good matter in his brain, he had, it
seems, ill materials in his body, for his heart was
shrivelled like a leather penny-purse when he was
dissected, nor were his lungs found.</p>

<p>"Being such a Clerk in the Law, all the world
wonders he left such an odd will, which is short and
in Latin. The substance of it is, that he having bequeathed
a few Legacies, and left his second son one
hundred marks a year, and nine hundred pounds in
money, enough to bring him up in his Father's Profession,
he concludes: <i>Reliqua meorum omnia primogenito
meo Edwardo, dissipanda nec melius unquam
(speravi) lego</i>: I leave the rest of my goods to my firstborn
Edward (mistake for Humphry), to be consum'd
or scattered (for I never hoped better). A strange, and
scarce a Christian Will, in my opinion, for it argues
uncharitableness. Nor doth the world wonder lesse,
that he should leave no Legacy to some of your Lordship's
children, considering what deep obligations he
had to your Lordship; for I am confident he had
never bin Attorney-General else."</p>

<p>Hals tells this story of Noye: "The Attorney-General
on a day havinge King Charles I and the principal
officers and nobilitie of his court, at a dinner at his
house in London, at which tyme the arch poet Ben
Jonson, and others being at an inne, on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the street; and wantinge both meate and money for
their subsistance, at that exigent resolved to trye an
expedient, to gett his dinner from the Attorney-General's
table, in order to which, by the landlord of
the inne aforesaid, he sent a white timber plate or
trencher to him, when the King was sate downe to
table, whereon was inscribed these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the world was drown'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deer was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because there was noe park;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Without e're a bitt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cause Noah hath all in his Arke.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which plate beinge presented by the Attorney-Generall
to the Kinge, produced this effect; that Jonson
had a good dish of venison sent him back by the
bearer to his great content and satisfaction, on which
aforesaid plate, by the King's direction, Jonson's
rhymes were thus inverted or contradicted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the world was drown'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There deer was found,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To quicken thy witt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which com' from Noya's Ark.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>William Noye anagram, I Moyle in law. He was
the blowcoal incendiary or stirrer up of the occasion of
the civill wars between Kinge Charles and his Parliament,
by assertinge and setting up the King's prerogative
to the highest pitch, as King James I had done
before, beyond the laws of the land as aforesaid. And
as counsill for the Kinge he prosecuted for Kinge
Charles I the imprisoned members of the House of
Commons, 1628, viz. Sir John Ellyot, Mr. Coryton and
others."</p>

<p>Noye died in 1638. Hals adds: "He had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
principal hand in the most oppressive expedients for
raising money for the King, and seems not to have
had the least notion of public spirit. He was, in a
word, a man of an enlarged head and a contracted
heart."</p>

<p>His portrait, formerly possessed by Davies Gilbert,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
has been engraved in Polwhele's <i>Biographical Sketches
in Cornwall</i>. The eldest son, Edward, was killed in a
duel by Captain Byron in France in 1636, and then
Carnanton passed to his brother Humphrey, a colonel
in King Charles' army, and Commissioner of the Peace
for the County of Cornwall. He married Hester,
daughter of Henry Sandys, and sister and coheiress
of George Lord Sandys of the Vine. He was as
worthless a fellow as his elder brother Edward, and
William Noye, the father, foresaw the ruin of the
family estates to whichever of his sons they fell;
for, in default of male issue, they were to go to
Humphrey Noye, not Edward as Howell states.
Humphrey by his bad conduct, riot and excess,
lost all the estate left him by his father except
Carnanton, and for many years lived on the charity of
his friends and on dishonest tricks; for being a magistrate
and generally chairman at the sessions, he took
bribes to pervert judgment; acquitting felons, etc., till
at last he was detected and struck out of the Commission.
Hals says: "After which growinge scandalous
for these and other misdemeanours, he was slighted by
his former friends, and put to great hardships to get a
subsistance necessary for the life of man (his creditors
beinge upon mortgages in possession of his whole
estate). However, it happened some time before his
death, that upon puttinge his hand and seale with his
creditors for conveying the manor of Amell and Trylly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
in Penwith to his son-in-lawe, Mr. Davies, on marrying
with his daughter Katherine, he had by them pay'd him
in cash £100 in consideration thereof. Soon after the
receipt of which money he sicken'd and dyed at Thomas
Wills' house in S. Colomb Towne, and left £80 in
cash, about the yeare 1683; which was more money
than he was possest of at one tyme for about twenty
yeares before; and the last words that he was heard to
speake, as his soule passed out of this life, was: 'Lord,
where am I goinge now?'"</p>

<p>Humphrey Noye had two sons, but both predeceased
him and died without issue. His daughter Hester
married Henry Davies, of Buryan, and had by him a
son, William, who left issue two daughters only.</p>

<p>Catherine, the second daughter, married in 1679
William Davies, of Bosworgy, who by her left issue
John Davies of Ednovean, whose daughter Catherine
married the Rev. Edward Giddy, whose son Davies
Giddy assumed the name and arms of Gilbert.</p>

<p>The third daughter, Bridgeman, married John
Willyams, of Roxworthy, but died childless. After her
death Willyams married Dorothy, daughter of Peter
Daye, gent., and by her had issue, and the family of
Willyams to this day possesses Carnanton.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM LEMON</h2>


<p>William Lemon was the son of a William
Lemon, of Germoe, in humble circumstances;
he was baptized at Breage,
15th November, 1696; his mother's
maiden name was Rodda. As a lad he obtained a
smattering of knowledge at a village school, sufficient
to enable him to enter an office as clerk to a Mr.
Coster. The story was told of him that as a boy he
had formed one link of a living chain, which, connected
only by the grasp of their hands, extended
itself into a tremendous surf, and rescued several
persons who had been shipwrecked.</p>

<p>Whilst still young he became manager of a tin-smelting
house at Chiandower, near Penzance, and
speedily acquired a great knowledge of mining in
Cornwall. In 1724 he married Isabella Vibert, of
Tolver-in-Gulval, and with her received a sufficient
fortune<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to enable him to indulge in speculations in
mines, and these turned out so happily that he embarked
still further in mining ventures. He was the
first who conceived the project of working the mines
upon a grand scale, and not of running them by small
bands of adventurers. A new era in mining opened
with the introduction of the steam-pump, and the first,
invented by Newcomen, of Dartmouth, was used in the
Great Work at Breage. William Lemon associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
himself George Blewett, of Marazion, and a Mr.
Dewin, and these three commenced working a mine on
a farm called Truvel, in Ludgvan, the property of
Lord Godolphin, and named Wheal Fortune, where
the second steam-engine was employed.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Lemon is said to have realized £10,000 out of
Wheal Fortune, and this enabled him to extend his
operations. He removed to Truro, and commenced
working the great Gwennap Mines on a scale unprecedented
in Cornwall. Carnan Adit was either actually
commenced, or at least was effectively prosecuted, by
Mr. Lemon; and as his means increased he soon
became the principal merchant and tin-smelter in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>But he was keenly alive to his deficient education.
He was shrewd, could calculate, but had no knowledge
of English literature, and his spelling was remarkable.
However, he set vigorously to work to correct his
defects, and late in life placed himself under the tuition
of Mr. Conon, master of the Truro Grammar School,
and even acquired a certain&mdash;not, certainly, very extensive&mdash;knowledge
of Latin.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemon had a favourite tame Cornish chough
that would always obey his call. If he were walking on
Truro Green, or through the streets, the chough would
fly to him instantly at his whistle, though it had been
associating with other birds or perched on a house-top.</p>

<p>It so happened that John Thomas, afterwards the
Warden of the Stannaries, but then a boy at Conon's
school, taking his gun, contrary to the rules of the
school, and going out shooting, unluckily killed the
chough. This produced a great outcry, and when he
was told that this was Mr. Lemon's favourite bird,
he strongly suspected that the least punishment he
would receive would be a flogging from his schoolmaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and a hiding as well from Mr. Lemon. But
Thomas took courage, went to Mr. Lemon's house,
knocked at the door, was admitted to Mr. Lemon, and
trembling and in tears confessed what he had done.
Mr. Lemon paused a moment, and then said that he
was sorry for the poor bird, but freely forgave the little
delinquent on account of his candour in acknowledging
his fault, and more than that, he promised to keep it a
secret, and if it should reach Conon's ears, would intercede
for him.</p>

<p>In 1742 he was Sheriff for the county. He became
one of the Truro magistrates, and might, had he cared
for it, have been elected as a member for one or other of
the Cornish boroughs.</p>

<p>He was author of a lucid argument written to Sir
Robert Walpole to obtain the withdrawal of a tax
levied on coals, and which acted prejudicially on the
Cornish mines. The presentation of this memorial is
thought to have been instrumental in obtaining for
him, from Frederick, Prince of Wales, a grant of all
minerals found in Cornwall, with the exception of tin;
and the Prince likewise sent him a present of silver
plate.</p>

<p>He bought Carclew in 1749, and died at Truro,
25th March, 1760, in the sixty-third year of his life.</p>

<p>He and his wife had one son only, William Lemon,
junior, who died some years before his father, leaving
two sons and a daughter. The elder, Sir William
Lemon, Bart.,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> represented the county of Cornwall in
Parliament during fifty years.</p>

<p>As an instance of the respect paid to the genius, and
above all the wealth of Mr. Lemon, the people of Truro
are said to have drawn back from their doors and windows
as he passed through the street, and the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Samuel Walker, when exhorting children at catechizing
to be circumspect in the presence of Almighty
God, said: "Only think, dear children, how careful
you would be if Mr. Lemon were looking upon
you."</p>

<p>Sir William's eldest son, Major William Lemon,
shot himself at Princes Street, Hanover Square,
London, early in 1799, when a young man of only
twenty-five.</p>

<p>The baronetcy is now extinct, and Carclew is the
residence and property of Captain W. Tremayne.</p>

<h2>SAMUEL DREW</h2>


<p>The life of Samuel Drew was written by his
eldest son, and published by Longman,
Rees, and Co. in 1834. It is a volume of
534 pages, and probably few would be disposed
to wade through it. Of his early days by far
the brighter account is that furnished by himself to
Mr. R. Polwhele; but the son supplies some anecdotes
that may be quoted.</p>

<p>"I was born on the 3rd March, 1765, in an obscure
cottage in the parish of S. Austell, about a mile and
a half distant from the town. My father was a
common labourer, and had through mere dint of
manual labour to provide for himself, a wife, and four
children, of whom I was the second. One child died in
infancy, and at the age of nine years<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> I had the misfortune
to lose my mother." Rather more than a year
before the death of Mrs. Drew, Samuel was set to work
at a neighbouring stamping-mill as a <i>buddle-boy</i>, and
for his services his father received three-halfpence a
day, but this was raised later to twopence, the largest
sum Samuel realized in that employment, though he
continued to work at it for more than two years.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">SAMUEL DREW</p>
</div>

<p>Not long after the death of his wife, Samuel's father
took a woman named Bate into the house, to act as
housekeeper; and in the second year of his widowhood
he married her, to the disgust of his children. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
she was entertaining her friends and gossips at tea after
the wedding, Samuel discharged a syringeful of water
over the party. This was more than she could put up
with, and Samuel had to be sent away and apprenticed
to a shoemaker named Baker, in the parish of S. Blazey.</p>

<p>He says himself: "My father, being exceedingly poor,
felt much embarrassment in finding a premium to give
to my master, with whom, at the age of ten years and a
half, I was bound an apprentice for nine years, which
length of time, together with five pounds five shillings,
was considered by my master as a suitable bargain. It
was at this tender age that I bid adieu to my father's
habitation, and as a place of residence have never
entered it since. The little knowledge of writing
which I had acquired from my father was almost
entirely lost during my apprenticeship; I had, however,
an opportunity at intervals of perusing Goadby's
<i>Weekly Entertainer</i>, and used to puzzle my little head
about riddles and enigmas, and felt much pleasure in
perusing the anecdotes which were occasionally interspersed
through the pages."</p>

<p>Whilst at the shoemaker's a curious incident occurred:
"There were several of us, boys and men, out about
twelve o'clock on a bright moonlight night. I think
we were poaching. The party were in a field adjoining
the road leading from my master's to S. Austell, and I
was stationed outside the hedge to watch and give the
alarm if any intruder should appear. While thus occupied
I heard what appeared to be the sound of a horse
approaching from the town, and I gave a signal. My
companions paused and came to the hedge where I was,
to see the passenger. They looked through the bushes,
and I drew myself close to the hedge, that I might not
be observed. The sound increased, and the supposed
horseman seemed drawing near. The clatter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
hoofs became more and more distinct. We all looked
to see who and what it was, and I was seized with a
strange, indefinable feeling of dread; when, instead of
a horse, there appeared coming towards us, at an easy
pace, but with the same sound which first caught
my ear, a creature about the height of a large dog.
It went close by me, and as it passed, it turned upon
me and my companions huge fiery eyes that struck
terror to all our hearts. The road where I stood
branched off in two directions, in one of which there
was a gate across. Towards the gate it moved, and,
without any apparent obstruction, went on at its regular
trot, which we heard several minutes after it had disappeared.
Whatever it was, it put an end to our
occupation, and we made the best of our way home.</p>

<p>"I have often endeavoured in later years, but without
success, to account, on natural principles, for what
I then heard and saw. As to the facts, I am sure there
was no deception. It was a night of unusual brightness,
occasioned by a cloudless full moon. The creature
was unlike any animal I had then seen, but from
my present recollections it had much the appearance of
a bear, with a dark shaggy coat. Had it not been
for the unearthly lustre of its eyes, and its passing
through the gate as it did, there would be no reason to
suppose it anything more than an animal perhaps
escaped from some menagerie. That it did pass through
the gate without pause or hesitation I am perfectly
clear. Indeed, we all saw it, and saw that the gate
was shut, from which we were not distant more than
twenty or thirty yards. The bars were too close to
admit the passage of an animal of half its apparent
bulk; yet this creature went through without effort or
variation of its pace."</p>

<p>He was roughly and cruelly treated by his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
who would beat him with the last, and at one time for a
while maimed him. At length he felt that he could
endure the bondage no more, and with sixteen-pence
ha'penny in his pocket he ran away with the intention
of going to Plymouth and seeking a berth on board a
man-of-war.</p>

<p>At this time Sam's father was in somewhat better
circumstances. He was chiefly employed in what was
called <i>riding Sherborne</i>. There was at that time scarcely
a bookseller in Cornwall; and the only newspaper
known among the common people was the <i>Sherborne
Mercury</i>, published weekly by Goadby and Co., who
also issued the <i>Weekly Entertainer</i>. The papers were
not sent by post, but by private messengers, who were
termed <i>Sherborne men</i>. Drew, senior, was one of these.
Between Plymouth and Penzance were two stages on
the main road, each about forty miles; and there were
branch riders, in different directions, who held regular
communication with each other and with the establishment
at Sherborne. Their business was to deliver the
newspapers, <i>Entertainers</i>, and any books that had been
ordered, to collect the money, and to take fresh orders.
Mr. Drew's stage was from S. Austell to Plymouth.
He always set off on his journey early on Monday
morning and returned on Wednesday.</p>

<p>When Samuel Drew had made up his mind to run
away, he did not choose the direct road for fear of encountering
his father, but took that by Liskeard.</p>

<p>"I went on through the night, and feeling fatigued,
went into a hay-field and slept. My luggage was no
encumbrance; as the whole of my property, besides
the clothes I wore, was contained in a small handkerchief.
Not knowing how long I should have to depend
on my slender stock of cash, I found it necessary to
use the most rigid economy. Having to pass over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
either a ferry or toll-bridge, for which I had to pay a
halfpenny, feeling my present situation, and knowing
nothing of my future prospects, this small call upon
my funds distressed me, I wept as I went on my way.
The exertion of walking and the fresh morning air
gave me a keener appetite than I thought it prudent
to indulge. I, however, bought a penny loaf,
and with a halfpenny-worth of milk in a farmer's house
ate half of my loaf for breakfast. In passing through
Liskeard my attention was attracted by a shoemaker's
shop, in the door of which a respectable-looking man,
whom I supposed to be the master, was standing.
Without any intention of seeking employment in this
place, I asked him if he could give me work; and he,
taking compassion, I suppose, on my sorry appearance,
promised to employ me the next morning. Before
I could go to work tools were necessary; and I was
obliged to lay out a shilling on these. Dinner, under
such circumstances, was out of the question; for supper
I bought another halfpenny-worth of milk, ate the remainder
of my loaf, and for a lodging again had
recourse to the fields. The next morning I purchased
another penny loaf and renewed my labour. My employer
soon found that I was a miserable tool, yet he
treated me kindly. I had now but one penny left, and
this I wished to husband till my labour brought a
supply; so for dinner I tied my apron-strings tighter
and went on with my work. My abstinence subjected
me to the jeers of my shopmates. One of them said to
another, 'Where does our shopmate dine?' and the
response was, 'Oh! he always dines at the sign of the
Mouth.' Half of the penny loaf which I took with me
in the morning I had allotted for my supper; but
before night came I had pinched it nearly all away in
mouthfuls through mere hunger. Very reluctantly I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
laid out my last penny, and with no enviable feelings
sought my former lodging in the open air."</p>

<p>But on the following day Samuel's father, having
learned where he was, came to remove him and take
him back to S. Austell. Compensation was made to
Baker, his indenture was cancelled, and he remained
at Polpea, where Mr. Drew now had a little farm, for
about four months.</p>

<p>Drew, the father, not only was occupied as a Sherborne
rider, but he was also a contractor for carrying
the mail between S. Austell and Bodmin, and he
chiefly employed his eldest son, Jabez, in carrying the
mails.</p>

<p>"At one time in the depth of winter I was borrowed
to supply my brother's place, and I had to travel in
the darkness of night through frost and snow a dreary
journey, out and home, of more than twenty miles.
Being overpowered with fatigue, I fell asleep on the
horse's neck, and when I awoke discovered that I had
lost my hat. The wind was keen and piercing, and
I was bitterly cold. I stopped the horse and endeavoured
to find out where I was; but it was so dark
that I could scarcely distinguish the hedges on each
side of the road, and I had no means of ascertaining
how long I had been asleep or how far I had travelled.
I then dismounted and looked around for my hat; but
seeing nothing of it, I turned back, leading the horse,
determined to find it if possible; for the loss of a hat
was to me of serious consequence. Shivering with
cold, I pursued my solitary way, scrutinizing the road
at every step, until I had walked about two miles, and
was on the point of giving up the search, when I came
to a receiving house, where I ought to have delivered
a packet of letters, but had passed it when asleep. To
this place the post usually came about one o'clock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the morning, and it was customary to leave a window
unfastened, except by a large stone outside, that the
family might not be disturbed at so unseasonable an
hour. I immediately put the letter-bag through the
window, and having replaced the stone, was turning
round to my horse, when I perceived my hat lying
close to my feet. I suppose that the horse, knowing
the place, must have stopped at the window for me to
deliver my charge; but having waited until his patience
was exhausted, had pursued his way to the next place.
My hat must have been shaken off by his impatient
movements."</p>

<p>The remarkable thing about this incident is that the
horse was quite blind, yet it could go its accustomed
road, and stop at accustomed places, without seeing.
By all the family this sagacious animal was much
prized, but Samuel's father felt for it a special regard;
and the attachment between the master and his faithful
servant was, to all appearance, mutual. Many years
before, the poor beast, in a wretched condition from
starvation and ill-usage, had been turned out on a
common to die. The owner willingly sold it for little
more than the value of the hide; and his new possessor,
having by care and kindness restored it to health and
strength, soon found that he had made a most advantageous
bargain. For more than twenty years he
and his blind companion travelled the road together.
After the horse was past labour it was kept in
the orchard and tended with almost parental care.
Latterly it became unable to bite the grass, and the old
man regularly fed it with bread sopped in milk. In
the morning it would put its head over the orchard
railing, towards its master's bedroom, and give its
accustomed neigh, whereupon old Mr. Drew would
jump out of bed, open the window, and call to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
horse, "My poor old fellow, I will be with thee soon."
And when the animal died, he would not allow the
skin or shoes to be taken off, but had the carcase
buried entire.</p>

<p>Samuel tells another story of instinct in brute
beasts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our dairy was under a room which was used occasionally
as a barn and apple-chamber, into which the
fowls sometimes found their way, and, in scratching
among the chaff, scattered the dust on the pans of milk
below, to the great annoyance of my mother-in-law.
In this a favourite cock of hers was the chief transgressor.
One day in harvest she went into the dairy,
followed by her little dog, and finding dust again
thrown on the milk-pans, she exclaimed, 'I wish that
cock were dead!' Not long after, she being with us
in the harvest field, we observed the little dog dragging
along the cock, just killed, which with an air of
triumph he laid at my mother-in-law's feet. She was
dreadfully exasperated at the literal fulfilment of her
hastily uttered wish, and, snatching a stick from the
hedge, attempted to give the luckless dog a beating.
The dog, seeing the reception he was likely to meet
with, where he expected marks of approbation, left the
bird and ran off, she brandishing her stick and saying
in a loud, angry tone, 'I'll pay thee for this by and by.'
In the evening she was about to put her threat into
execution, when she found the little dog established in
a corner of the room and a large one standing before
it. Endeavouring to fulfil her intention by first driving
off the large dog, he gave her plainly to understand
that he was not at all disposed to relinquish his
post. She then sought to get at the small dog behind
the other, but the threatening gesture and fiercer growl
of the large one sufficiently indicated that the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
would be not a little perilous. The result was that she
was obliged to abandon her design. In killing the
cock I can scarcely think the dog understood the precise
import of my stepmother's wish, as his immediate
execution of it would seem to imply. The cock was a
more recent favourite, and had received some attentions
which had been previously bestowed upon himself.
This, I think, had led him to entertain a feeling
of hostility to the bird, which he did not presume to
indulge until my mother's tone and manner indicated
that the cock was no longer under her protection. In
the power of communicating with each other which
these dogs evidently possessed, and which, in some
instances, has been displayed by this species of
animal, a faculty seems to be developed of which we know
very little. On the whole, I never remember to have
met with a case in which, to human appearance, there
was a nearer approach to moral perception than in that
of my father's two dogs."</p>

<p>Samuel Drew remained with his father's family from
midsummer, 1782, till the autumn of the same year,
and then took a situation in a shoemaker's shop at Millbrook,
on the Cornish side of the estuary of the Tamar.
After having been there for a year he moved to Cawsand
and then to Crafthole, where he got mixed up in
smuggling ventures.</p>

<p>Port Wrinkle, which Crafthole adjoins, lies about
the middle of the extensive bay reaching from Looe
Island to the Rame Head. It is little more than a
fissure among the rocks which guard the long line of
coast; and being exposed to the uncontrolled violence
of the prevailing winds, affords a very precarious
shelter.</p>

<p>Notice was given through Crafthole one evening,
about the month of December, 1784, that a vessel laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
with contraband goods was on the coast, and would be
ready to discharge her cargo. At nightfall Samuel
Drew, with the rest of the male population, made
towards the port. One party remained on the rocks to
make signals and dispose of the goods when landed;
the other, of which he was one, manned the boats.
The night was intensely dark; and but little progress
had been made in discharging the vessel's cargo when
the wind freshened, with a heavy sea. To prevent the
ship being driven on to the rocks it was found expedient
to stand off from the port; but this greatly increased
the risk to those in the boats. Unfavourable as these
circumstances were, all seemed resolved to persevere;
and several trips were made between the vessel and the
shore. The wind continuing to increase, one of the
men in the boat with Drew had his hat blown off, and
in leaning over the gunwale in his attempt to secure
it, upset the boat, and three of the men were drowned.
Samuel and two others clung to the keel for a time, but
finding that they were drifting out to sea, they were
constrained to let go and sustain themselves by swimming.
But the night was pitch dark, and immersed in
the waters they knew not in which direction to swim.
Samuel had given himself up as lost, when he laid hold
of a tangled mass of floating seaweed, and was able to
sustain himself on that. At length he approached some
rocks near the shore, upon which he and two other
men, the only survivors of seven, managed to crawl;
but they were so benumbed with cold and so much
exhausted by their exertions that the utmost they could
do was to cling to the rocks and let the sea wash
over them. When a little recovered, they shouted
for help, but the other boatmen were concerned in
transporting their lading of kegs on shore, and not
till the vessel had discharged all her cargo did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
make any attempt to rescue the half-drowned men.
Eventually they removed them to a farmhouse, where a
blazing fire was kindled on the hearth and fresh faggots
piled on it, while the half-drowned men, who
were placed in a recess of the chimney, unable to
relieve themselves, were compelled to endure the
excessive heat which their companions thought was
necessary to restore animation. The result was that
they were half roasted. Samuel Drew says: "My first
sensation was that of extreme cold. It was a long time
before I felt the fire, though its effects are still visible
on my legs, which are burnt in several places. The
wounds continued open more than two years, and the
marks I shall carry to my grave."</p>

<p>The death of his elder brother Jabez produced a profound
impression on Samuel, and he became a Methodist.</p>

<p>"For the space of about four or five years I
travelled through different parts of Cornwall, working
whenever I could obtain employment; and during
this period, waded through scenes of domestic distress,
which can be interesting only to myself. <i>Literature</i>
was a term to which I could annex no idea. <i>Grammar</i>
I knew not the meaning of. An opportunity, however,
now offering one an advance in wages at S. Austell,
I embraced it, and came hither to work with rather an
eccentric character. My master was by trade a saddler,
had acquired some knowledge of book-binding, and
hired me to carry on the shoe-making for him. My
master was one of those men who will live anywhere,
but get rich nowhere. His shop was frequented by
persons of a more respectable class than those with
whom I had previously associated; and various topics
became alternately the subjects of conversation. I
listened with all that attention which my labour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
good manners would permit me, and obtained among
them some little knowledge. About this time disputes
ran high in S. Austell between the Calvinists and
Arminians, and our shop afforded a considerable scene
of action. In cases of uncertain issue, I was sometimes
appealed to to decide upon a doubtful point. This,
perhaps, flattering my vanity, became a new stimulus
to action. I listened with attention, examined dictionaries,
picked up many words, and, from an attachment
which I felt to books that were occasionally brought
to his shop to bind, I began to have some view of the
various theories with which they abounded. The
more, however, I read, the more I felt my own ignorance;
and the more I felt my own ignorance, the
more invincible became my energy to surmount it; and
every leisure moment was now employed in reading
one thing or other.... After having worked with
this master about three years, I well recollect, a neighbouring
gentleman brought <i>Locke's Essay on the
Human Understanding</i> to be bound. I had never seen
or heard of these books before. I took an occasion to
look into them, when I thought his mode of reasoning
very pretty and his arguments exceedingly strong. I
watched all opportunities of reading for myself, and
would willingly have laboured a fortnight to have had
the books. They, however, were soon carried away,
and with them all my future improvement by their
means. I never saw his essay again for many years,
yet the early impression was not forgotten, and it is
from this accidental circumstance that I received my
first bias for abstruse subjects.</p>

<p>"My master growing inattentive to his shoe-making
trade, many of my friends advised me to commence
business for myself, and offered me money for that
purpose. I accepted the offer, started accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
and by mere dint of application, in about one year
discharged my debts and stood alone. My leisure
hours I now employed in reading, or scribbling anything
which happened to pass my mind."</p>

<p>Thus he went on till 1798, when he laid the foundation
of an <i>Essay on the Immortality of the Soul</i>. Whilst
engaged upon this he had T. Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i>
put into his hands. He read it, but saw the fallacy of
many of his arguments, and he wrote his remarks on
the book, and published them in pamphlet form at
S. Austell in 1799.</p>

<p>Through this tract he obtained acquaintance with
the Rev. John Whitaker, to whom he showed his MS.
on <i>The Immortality of the Soul</i>, and was encouraged
to revise, continue, and complete the essay, and it was
published in November, 1802.</p>

<p>"During these literary pursuits I regularly and constantly
attended on my business, and do not recollect
that ever one customer has been disappointed by me
through these means. While attending to my trade,
I sometimes catch the fibres of an argument, which I
endeavour to note the prominent features of, and keep
a pen and ink by me for the purpose. In this state,
what I can collect through the day remains on any
paper which I have at hand till the business of the day
is dispatched and my shop shut up, when, in the
midst of my family, I endeavour to analyze, in the
evening, such thoughts as had crossed my mind
during the day."</p>

<p>At one time the bent of Drew's mind was towards
astronomy, but when he considered how impossible
it was for him, without means, to purchase a powerful
telescope, to make any progress in the study of the
stars, he abandoned the thought and devoted himself
to metaphysics&mdash;perhaps one of the most unprofitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
of all studies. His works were, however, read by some
when they issued from the press, and are now no
longer even looked into.</p>

<p>A friend one day remarked to him, "Mr. Drew,
more than once I have heard you quote the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you by my own experience," replied
Drew. "When I began business I was a great
politician. For the first year I had too much to
think about to indulge my propensity for politics;
but, getting a little ahead in the world, I began to
dip into these matters again, and entered into newspaper
argument as if my livelihood depended on it;
my shop was filled with loungers, who came to canvass
public measures. This encroached on my time, and
I found it necessary sometimes to work till midnight
to make up for the hours I lost. One night, after my
shutters were closed, and I was busily employed, some
little urchin who was passing put his mouth to the
keyhole of the door, and with a shrill pipe called out,
'Shoemaker! Shoemaker! Work by night and run
about by day!' Had a pistol been fired off at my ear
I could not have been more confounded. From that
time I turned over a new leaf. I ceased to venture on
the restless sea of politics, or trouble myself about
matters which did not concern me. The bliss of
ignorance on political topics I often experienced in
after life&mdash;the folly of being wise my early history
shows."</p>

<p>His sister kept house for him. One market-day a
country-woman entered his shop, and having completed
her purchases, remarked that she thought he
would be more comfortable if he had a wife. Drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
assented, but said, "I don't know any one who would
have me." "Oh! that's easily settled," said the
woman, and left. Next market-day she returned,
bringing her buxom, apple-cheeked daughter with
her. "There, Mr. Drew," said she; "I brought this
maid, who will make 'ee a good wife."</p>

<p>Samuel demurred; he neither knew the family nor
the qualities and character of the wench.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless 'ee!" said the woman, when he made
these objections, "take her. The trial of the pudding
is in the eating."</p>

<p>He declined the proposal, however; but this incident
turned his mind to matrimony, and on April 17th, 1791,
when in his twenty-seventh year, he married Honor
Halls, and by her had five sons and three daughters.
His wife's immediate fortune was £10, a sum of great
importance at that time to him. Three years after it
was increased by a legacy of £50.</p>

<p>Having made a certain amount of success with his
<i>Essay on the Immortality of the Soul</i>, Drew next undertook
one on <i>The Identity and Resurrection of the Human
Body</i>, and this was published in 1809.</p>

<p>Into a controversy he was engaged in with Mr.
Polwhele in 1800 on Methodism we need not enter,
but it made no breach of friendly feeling between Mr.
Polwhele and him, and it was at the request of the
former that Drew wrote the little account of his life that
appeared in Polwhele's <i>Literary Characters</i>, 1803.</p>

<p>Having experienced his own great difficulties in
acquiring the principles of the English grammar, in
1804 he gave a course of lectures on that subject.
These lectures, which occupied about two hours, were
delivered on four evenings of the week, two being
allotted to each sex separately. A year completed the
course of instruction, and for this each pupil paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
thirty shillings. He was able to illustrate his lectures
very happily with anecdote and from his own experience,
so as to render the barren study of grammar
interesting and entertaining. Though never able to
write first-class English, and often clumsy in diction,
yet he was studiously correct in grammar, if often awkward
in construction of a sentence.</p>

<p>In the year 1805 he gave up his cobbling business
and devoted himself entirely to his pen. Seeing his
value as a polemic writer in favour of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity, several of the clergy of
Cornwall were anxious that he should join the Church;
but his early association with Dissent, and his ignorance
of Catholic doctrine, induced him to remain where
he was in the Methodist Connection.</p>

<p>He next wrote an <i>Essay on the Being and Attributes
of the Deity</i>, and a reply to Thomas Prout, <i>On the
Divinity of Christ and the Eternal Sonship</i>. All this
was very well in its way at the time, but is now so
much waste paper, used only for covering jampots.</p>

<p>In 1814 Samuel Drew undertook his most voluminous
work, the <i>History of Cornwall</i>, one which he was
wholly unqualified to undertake, as he had no familiarity
with the MS. material on which that history
should be based; and it was a mere compilation from
already printed matter.</p>

<p>In 1819 Samuel Drew removed to Liverpool, where
he acted as local preacher in the Methodist meeting-houses.
To this period belongs the epigram written
on him by Dr. Clarke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long was the man, and long was his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long was the coat which this long man did wear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He became editor of the <i>Imperial Magazine</i>, and
after a short while in Liverpool, migrated to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1828 he lost his wife. "When my wife died," he
was wont to say, "my earthly sun set for ever."</p>

<p>In 1833 he returned to Cornwall, and died at Helston
on March 29th, at the age of sixty-eight.</p>

<p>Slender in form, with a head remarkably small for
the length of his limbs, his stature exceeded the
common height. He had a searching and intelligent
eye, was somewhat uncouth in his movements, but was
full of energy of mind and body. He sometimes wrote
verses, which only a very partial biographer would
call poetry. But what he prided himself on being was
not a poet, but a metaphysician.</p>

<p>The story goes that S. Augustine was walking one
day by the seashore, musing on the attributes of God
and on the demonstration of the Divine nature, when
he saw a child digging a hole in the sand, and then
with a fan-shell ladling the sea-water into the hole it
had made.</p>

<p>S. Augustine paused and asked, "My child, what
are you about?"</p>

<p>"I am going to empty the sea into this hole,"
replied the child.</p>

<p>Then S. Augustine entered into himself and thought:
"Can a man with the limited capacity of his brain
embrace the infinity of the Divine nature and perfections?
Is it not like emptying the sea into a tiny hole
to try to effect this?"</p>

<p>Drew's life labours were just doing this. There was
a certain amount of intellectual ingenuity in his arguments,
but that was all. Not a leaf that he wrote is of
any permanent value, but that it was of value at the
time when he wrote I should be the last to deny.</p>

<p>There is abundant material for a life of Samuel
Drew. Not only may it be found in the life by his son
mentioned at the head of this article, and in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
biographical memoir given by R. Polwhele, but his
son J. H. Drew also published a second memoir, under
the title <i>Samuel Drew, M. A., the Self-Taught Cornishman;
A Life Lesson</i>, published in 1861; also in
<i>Lives of the Illustrious</i>, by J. P. Edwards, 1852; and
Mr. Smiles has devoted some pages to him in <i>Self-Help</i>,
1866. The portrait of Samuel Drew is given as frontispiece
to the first volume of <i>The Imperial Magazine</i>,
1819, and also to the <i>Life</i> by his son.</p>

<h2>THE SIEGE OF SKEWIS</h2>


<p>Skewis is a small, not very interesting farmhouse
in itself, on the high road from Camborne
to Helston, near the station of Nancegollan.
Although at a distance of five miles
from Tregonning Hill, that height crowned by a stone
camp, and with two camps on its slopes, seems to
dominate it. The country around is bleak and treeless
except in dips, and where are the grounds of Clowance.
To the north is the camp of Tregeare, where
was once seated an ancient family of the same name,
which died out in the reign of William of Orange
with Richard Tregeare, sheriff of Cornwall. Skewis
had been for some time the patrimony of a succession
of yeoman proprietors of the name of Rogers.</p>

<p>In 1734 there were two brothers of that name sons
of the owner of Skewis. On their father's death the
eldest succeeded to the property, and the younger,
Henry, carried on the trade of pewterer in Helston.
Both were married, but the elder had no children,
whereas Henry had several.</p>

<p>On the death of the elder brother, his widow, whose
maiden name had been Millett, produced a will whereby
her late husband had bequeathed all his freehold property
to her. This greatly exasperated Henry, who
considered that as Skewis had belonged to the Rogers
family for many generations, he was entitled to it, and
he averred that the will had been wrung from his dying
brother by the importunity of the wife when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
feeble in mind as well as body. Forthwith, in place of
disputing the will when proved, he took forcible
possession of the house, and turned out of it some
female servants left in charge of it whilst his sister-in-law
was from home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_456.png" id="i_456.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_456.png" alt="HENRY ROGERS: PEWTERER" title="HENRY ROGERS: PEWTERER" />
   <p class="caption2">HENRY ROGERS: PEWTERER</p>
</div>

<p>The whole neighbourhood was satisfied that great
wrong had been done to Henry Rogers, and was loud
in its condemnation of the widow.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Rogers found herself forcibly dispossessed
she appealed to the law, and judgment was
given against Henry.</p>

<p>Stephen Tillie was under-sheriff, and he received
orders to eject Rogers, and place Anne, the widow,
in possession. On June 18th, 1734, he accordingly
went to Skewis to serve the summons. But Henry
stood at an upper window armed with a gun, and dared
the under-sheriff to approach. Tillie shouted to him
that he had the King's writ and must have possession,
but assured him that he would not meddle with his
person.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd of some two or three hundred
persons had assembled, all sympathizers with Henry
Rogers, and murmuring their disapproval of the
ejectment.</p>

<p>Henry, from his window, called out that the Lord
Chancellor had made an unjust decree.</p>

<p>Tillie replied that Henry Rogers might appeal against
the decision, but surrender the house he must.</p>

<p>Rogers, in reply, fired, and, as the under-sheriff
stated, "burned his wig and singed his face."</p>

<p>This so frightened Tillie that he withdrew, and sent
to Helston for some soldiers; and Captain Sadler, then
in charge of the military there, despatched some to his
aid.</p>

<p>So reinforced, on the morrow Tillie went again to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Skewis, and found the door shut, and a hole cut in it,
with a gun-barrel protruding.</p>

<p>Again the under-sheriff demanded admittance, and
for reply the gun was fired, and a bailiff named
William Carpenter was mortally wounded. Another
gun was then discharged, and Hatch, the under-sheriff's
servant, was struck. Anne Rogers, the
plaintiff, was in the rear animating the soldiers against
the occupants of the house. Mrs. Henry Rogers was
within, loading and serving out the guns to her husband
and to his servant John Street. A soldier was
shot in the groin, and two other men were wounded.
Thereupon the soldiers fired upon the house, and
though the bullets flew in at the window, none of
those within were hurt.</p>

<p>Woolsten, the soldier shot in the groin, was taken to
the rear, where he died. A bullet whizzed through
Stephen Tillie's hat. Discretion is the better part of
valour. Accordingly the under-sheriff gave orders
to beat a retreat, and like the King of France's men
who marched up a hill and then marched down again,
Tillie and his posse of bailiffs and military retired from
the battlefield, carrying their dead and wounded, without
having effected an entry. In a kindly spirit Rogers
offered Tillie a dram, but the under-sheriff's courage
was too much quailed to allow him to draw near
enough to accept the hospitable offer.</p>

<p>Indeed, it took Mr. Tillie nine months to gather up
sufficient courage to resume the attack, and then not
till he had ordered up cannon from Pendennis Castle.
On the former occasion there had been at least ten
soldiers under the command of an officer. Within the
house were only Henry Rogers, his wife, his small
children, and his servant-man.</p>

<p>On March 16th, in the year following, another party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
was sent to apprehend Rogers and take possession of
the house. On this occasion, apparently Mr. Stephen
Tillie did not put in his appearance, but left the duty to
be discharged by the constables. Henry Rogers was
prepared for them, and fired, when one named Andrew
Willis, alias Tubby, was shot dead. Rogers then,
with the utmost coolness, came out of the door and
walked round the man he had shot, and again on this
occasion offered the besiegers a drink. The besiegers
then retired, but not till a second man had been
shot.</p>

<p>During the night Henry Rogers effected his escape.
He travelled on foot to Salisbury, with the intention of
making his case known to the King.</p>

<p>Sir John S. Aubyn, of Clowance, now took an active
part in endeavouring to secure the fugitive, and handbills
descriptive of Rogers were circulated along the
road to London, whither it was known he was making
his way. Near Salisbury a postboy, driving homewards
a return post-chaise, was accosted by a stout
man walking with a gun in his hand, who requested to
be given a lift. The boy drove him to the inn, where
he procured a bed; but the circumstances and description
had excited strong suspicion, and he was secured
in his sleep. The prisoner was removed to Cornwall.
He and his man Street were tried at the assizes at
Launceston on August 1st, 1735, were both found
guilty of murder, and were both hanged.</p>

<p>It is not possible to withhold sympathy from both men,
especially Street, who acted on the belief that it was his
duty to be true to his master, and to defend him and his
property to the utmost.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies Gilbert gives the minutes of an interesting
conversation he had with the son of Henry Rogers who
was hanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the 30th October, 1812, I called on Mr. Henry
Rogers, formerly a saddler at Penzance, but then residing
there in great poverty, being supported by a small
allowance from a club, and by half a crown a week
given him by the Corporation, nominally for yielding
up the possession of a house, but in truth to prevent
his becoming a common pauper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henry Rogers was then eighty-four years of
age and remembered the unfortunate transactions at
Skewis perfectly well; he was between seven and eight
years old at the time. He recollected going out with
his father into the court after there had been some
firing. His father had a gun in his hand, and
inquired what they wanted. On this his father
was fired at, and had a snuff-box and powder-horn
broken in his pocket by a ball, whilst he stood on
the other side.</p>

<p>"He recollected that whilst he was in bed, several
balls came in through the windows of the room, and
after striking the wall rolled about on the floor.</p>

<p>"One brother and a sister, who were in the house,
went out to inquire what was wanted of their father, and
they were not permitted to return.</p>

<p>"On the last night, no one remained in the house
but his father, himself, and the servant-maid. In the
middle of the night they all went out, and got some
distance from the house. In crossing a field, however,
they were met by two soldiers, who inquired their business.
The maid answered that they were looking for a
cow, when they were permitted to proceed. The soldiers
had their arms, and his father had his gun. The maid
and himself were left at a farmhouse in the neighbourhood,
and Mr. Rogers proceeded on his way towards
London."</p>

<h2>THE VOYAGE OF JOHN SANDS</h2>


<p>Lanarth, in the parish of S. Keverne, in the
Lizard district, was for many generations
the residence of the family of Sands. The
family was not represented at the Heralds'
Visitation of 1620, and did not record its arms and
pedigree, but was nevertheless regarded in the eighteenth
century as "gentle," and was united to other
families of respectability.</p>

<p>Sampson Sands, who died in 1696, was married to
Jane, daughter of John Coode, of Breage, but he died
without issue and left his estate to his brother's son,
John Sands, married to a daughter of Hamley, of
S. Neot.</p>

<p>This John Sands, one afternoon in January, 1702-3,
and seven other persons, men and women, of
S. Keverne, were returning from Falmouth in a fishing
boat of about five tons burden, without deck or
covering, after having done their marketing at a fair
there.</p>

<p>When they had got to sea, about a league from the
mouth of the Fal and about two leagues off S. Keverne,
suddenly there rose a storm of wind from the west,
and the sea rising and rolling in great crested waves
round the terrible points of the Manacles, the rowers
were unable to make headway against it. If they
could not reach Porthoustock, for which they were
bound, they hoped at least to run into Porthallow.
But even this they were unable to effect. The fury of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the blast and the great masses of water heaved against
the little boat made progress impossible, and they
resolved on running back into Falmouth harbour.
Accordingly the vessel was turned, but the raging
wind and sea and the tide setting out from the land
swept them from the coast. Moreover, the short
winter day was closing in. The sun went down
behind a wild and inky bank of cloud, and speedily
night set in dark and terrible. The unfortunate boatload
of marketers could do no more than invoke God's
protection, and bail out the water as fast as it poured
over the gunwale. The oars were shipped, and the
boatmen declared that there was nothing to be done
but to let loose the helm and allow the boat to
drive.</p>

<p>The night was cold as well as tempestuous. On
the blast of the wind came down torrents of rain. The
men and women alike laboured hard to cast out of the
boat the water that poured in. For sixteen hours
darkness lasted. How may each have said with
Gonzalo: "Now would I give a thousand furlongs of
sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown
furze, anything. I would fain die a dry death." At
length there rose a raw light in the south-east, against
which the billows stood up black as ink. As the light
grew, those in the boat found themselves encircled
with sea, out of sight of land, and with the clouds
scudding overhead, as if running a race. The storm
continued all that day and the night following. Not
only so, but also the third day and night the battle
with the influx of water continued. There was no
sleep for any; all had to fight the water for their lives.
Happily they were not starving, for Mr. Sands had
taken over to Falmouth in the boat a woman, the
taverner's wife of the "Three Tuns," who had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
with her from Falmouth a shilling's worth of bread
and three or four gallons of brandy. On this they
subsisted.</p>

<p>On the fourth day in the morning, the gale abated,
and at ten o'clock land was descried. Forthwith the
rowers bent to their oars and steered towards it. When
the whole party landed they discovered that they had
been wafted over to the coast of Normandy; and they
found themselves on French soil at the time that Queen
Anne was engaged in war with Louis XIV. Marlborough
had been in the Netherlands, and had reduced
Venloo, Ruremonde, and the citadel of Liége. At sea
Rooke had captured six vessels and sunk thirteen at
Vigo, and Admiral Benbow had done wonders against a
French fleet in the West Indies. The French were sore
and irritated. So soon as Mr. Sands and his little
party stepped on shore they were encountered by
several men armed, who demanded who they were.
They replied that they were English. One of the party
stopping them understood our language, and inquired
the occasion of these visitors landing on the enemy's
shores, and by what expedient they had come over.
They replied, and gave an account of their perilous
voyage of three nights and four days.</p>

<p>Upon this a gentleman of the company asked
Mr. Sands from what part of England he came, and
when he replied that they were all from Cornwall, the
same gentleman inquired further whether the leader
of the party was named Sands; to this he replied, in
some surprise, that he was.</p>

<p>"Then, monsieur," said the Frenchman, "I know
you, and I can well remember your kindness and
hospitality when I was wrecked off the Lizard some
years ago. Then you received me into your house, and
entertained me most generously."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>This was an unexpected and welcome encounter.
The gentleman then required the party to surrender
what arms and money they had with them, and Mr.
Sands handed over forty guineas that he had received
at Falmouth for pilchards just before he was driven out
to sea in the boat. He and his companions were
required to yield themselves prisoners of war; and
Mr. Sands was received into the gentleman's home.
All next day were brought before a magistrate and
examined, and orders were given that they should not
be kept in custody as prisoners of war, but should be
permitted to go about at liberty, and beg alms of the
people. And the kind-hearted Normandy peasants and
gentlemen showed them great favour, and supplied all
their pressing wants.</p>

<p>The news of the event not only flew over the country,
but reached the ears of the King, who thereupon ordered
that the whole party should be sent back to England by
the first transport ship for prisoners of war; which
happened soon after.</p>

<p>Mr. Sands took leave of his kind host in whose house
he had been hospitably entertained, and begged him to
accept the forty guineas as some acknowledgment of
his kindness. This, however, the gentleman refused
to do, saying that he would take nothing at his
hands, since God in such a wonderful manner had preserved
him and his companions from the perils of the
deep. Then Mr. Sands pressed five guineas on the
wife of his host, begging her with that sum to purchase
something which might remind her of him and his
party; and this she reluctantly received.</p>

<p>So they parted, and all went on board a transport
ship and were safely landed at Portsmouth; and in
eight weeks after their departure from England returned
to S. Keverne, to the great joy and surprise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
their friends and relations, who had concluded that all
of them had been drowned.</p>

<p>The Rev. Sampson Sandys was grandson of the
gentleman who was carried over to France, as described.
He lived at Lanarth to a great age. His daughter
Eleanor married Admiral James Kempthorne, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span>
He was succeeded at Lanarth by his nephew, William
Sandys, a colonel in the army of the East India Company,
who rebuilt the house. It must be added that
the original name of the family was not Sandys but
Sands, and that it assumed the former name as more
euphonious and as supposing a connection which, however,
has not been proved to exist, with Lord Sandys
of The Vine, and Ombersley, Worcestershire, and the
Cumberland family of Graythwaite. At the same time,
it assumed the arms of the same distinguished family,
<i>or</i>, a fesse dancetté between three crosses crosslet fichée
<i>gules</i>.</p>

<h2>CHARLES INCLEDON</h2>


<p>This, one of the sweetest tenor singers England
has produced, was born at S. Keverne in
Cornwall, in 1764, and was the son of a
petty local surgeon and apothecary practising
there.</p>

<p>At the age of seven he was introduced by Mr.
Snow, one of the minor canons of Exeter Cathedral,
to the organist, then named Langdon, and he afterwards
became the pupil of William Jackson the composer,
who was for many years organist of the cathedral.
Jackson took great notice of the boy, and made him
sing his own compositions at concerts in the city.
On one occasion, when the assizes were on at Exeter,
Judge Nares attended in state at the morning service in
the cathedral, when Incledon sang the solo "Let my
soul love," in the anthem, "Let my complaint come
before Thee, O Lord," with such effect and beauty
that the tears rolled down the judge's cheeks, and at
the conclusion of Divine service he sent for the boy
and presented him with five guineas.</p>

<p>Incledon was wont, on summer evenings, to seat
himself on a rail in the cathedral close and sing, to the
delight of an audience that always collected as soon as
his bird-like voice was heard. On one such occasion
he was singing the song "When I was a shepherd's
maid," from <i>The Padlock</i>, when a gentleman in regimentals
stepped forward and asked his name. Next
day this officer, the Hon. Mr. Trevor, called on Jackson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
and asked permission to take the lad with him to
Torquay, where he was going to visit Commodore
Walsingham of the <i>Thunderer</i>, and he desired to give
his friend and all on board ship the pleasure of hearing
Incledon sing. Permission was accorded, and the boy
was on board the vessel for three days, and sang
several nautical and other songs, beginning with
"Blow high, blow low." The Commodore was so
delighted that he wrote to Incledon's parents and
asked that the lad might be placed under him in the
vessel; but the mother declined, and well was it that
she did, for the <i>Thunderer</i> went down in a storm in
the West Indies, and all hands on board were lost.</p>

<p>The kind reception accorded to Charles Incledon on
board induced him to harbour the resolution to become
a sailor, and accompanied by a fellow chorister, and
carrying a bundle of linen, he ran away, hoping to
reach Plymouth; but he was overtaken and brought
back, and as a punishment was not allowed to wear his
surplice in choir for a week.</p>

<p>But when his voice broke, then he was allowed to
follow his bent, and he embarked on board the <i>Formidable</i>
under Captain Stanton, and remained in her two
years, till, disabled by a wound, he was left at Plymouth,
and on his recovery was placed in a vessel commanded
by Lord Harvey, afterwards Earl of Bristol. With
this nobleman he sailed to Sta. Lucia, where the whole
fleet was at anchor. Whilst there, Lord Harvey gave
a dinner on board to his fellow commanders and other
officers. At the same time the sailors before the mast
enjoyed themselves with grog and songs. When
Incledon sang, the lieutenant on deck ran to the cabin
where the officers were regaling themselves, and told
them that they had a nightingale on board, and would
do well to hear it sing. Lord Harvey at once proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
to the quarter-deck, heard Incledon sing the fine old
traditional ballad, "'Twas Thursday in the Morn," and
was so impressed that he bade him at once change his
apparel and come to the state cabin. He did so and
sang there "The Fight of the Monmouth and Foudroyant,"
"Rule Britannia," and some of Jackson's favourite
canzonets. The officers applauded enthusiastically,
and jocularly appointed him Singer to the British
Fleet. He was released from the performance of manual
duty, and sent for to assist at every entertainment that
succeeded. He rose high in the favour of Admiral
Pigot, the Commander-in-Chief, and made numerous
friends and patrons.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1782 Incledon was in the engagement between the
English fleet under Admiral Sir George Bridges,
afterwards Lord Rodney, and the French fleet commanded
by the Count de Grasse, when the former
gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the war Incledon was discharged
at Chatham and proceeded to London, with strong
recommendations from Lord Mulgrave and others to
Mr. Colman of the Haymarket Theatre. Colman
received him coldly, and gave him no hopes of an
engagement. Then he went to Southampton, where he
obtained an engagement at ten shillings and sixpence
a week. But soon after, owing to some dispute, he left
the company and went to Salisbury with a travelling
company, and fell into great poverty and misery.
However, he succeeded in obtaining an engagement at
Bath with Mr. Palmer, the well-known theatrical
manager, and the man who introduced mail-coaches
into England. Here he received thirty shillings a
week. He attracted the attention of Ranzzini, the
arbiter of the musical entertainments at Bath; and this
able man gave him valuable instruction in scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
singing. One evening, hearing Incledon sing
Handel's "Total Eclipse," the Italian was so delighted
that, catching hold of his hand, he left the piano, and
leading him to the front of the platform exclaimed,
"Ladies an jentleman, dis is my scholar!"</p>

<p>Thomas Harris, hearing him at Bath, proposed that
he should sing and act at Covent Garden Theatre, and
engaged him for three years at six, seven, and eight
pounds a week. Hardly was this agreement made,
when Linley, of Drury Lane, offered him twelve pounds
a week, and to retain him for five years. But, although
only a verbal agreement had been entered into with
Harris, Incledon, to his honour, rejected the offer of
Linley. It was unfortunate in more ways than one, as
he would have profited by Linley's exquisite taste and
instruction, as well as have earned nearly double what
Harris offered. Moreover, he was very badly treated
at Covent Garden, and often not given parts in
which he could do himself justice. In 1809 came a
rupture, and the managers dismissed him, and Incledon
quitted London on a provincial tour. After two years
he was re-engaged by Harris, at a salary of seventeen
pounds a week, for a term of five years; but he
stipulated that he should be given such rôles as suited
him. This engagement was not fulfilled, and a fresh
quarrel ensued that led to a final rupture at the end of
three years, and he quitted Covent Garden for ever,
refusing even to sing in the Oratorios performed there
during Lent.</p>

<p>He had made his first appearance at Covent
Garden in October, 1790, as Dermont in <i>The Poor
Soldier</i>, by Shield. His vocal endowments were
certainly great; he had a voice of uncommon power
and sweetness, both in the natural and falsetto. The
former was from A to G, a compass of about fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
notes; the latter he could use from D to E or even F,
or about ten notes. His natural voice was full and
open, and of such ductility, that when he sang
<i>pianissimo</i> it retained its original quality. His falsetto
was rich, sweet, and brilliant, and totally unlike the
other. He could use it with facility, and execute in it
ornaments of a certain class with volubility and sweetness.
His shake was good, and his intonation much
more correct than is common to singers so imperfectly
educated. But he never quite got over his West-country
pronunciation. His strong point was the
ballad, and that not the modern sentimental composition,
but of the robust old school. When Ranzzini
first heard him at Bath, rolling his voice upwards
like a surge of the sea, till, touching the top note, it
expired in sweetness, he exclaimed in rapture, "<i>Corpo
di Dio!</i> it was ver' lucky dere vas some roof above or
you would be heard by de angels in Heaven, and make
dem jealous."</p>

<p>Incledon himself used to tell a story of the effect he
produced upon Mrs. Siddons: "She paid me one of
the finest compliments I ever received. I sang 'The
Storm' after dinner; she cried and sobbed like a child.
Taking both my hands, she said: 'All that I and my
brother ever did is nothing to the effect you produce.'"</p>

<p>"I remember," says William Robson, in <i>The Old
Playgoer</i>, "when the élite of taste and science and
literature were assembled to pay the well-deserved
compliment of a dinner to John Kemble, and to present
him with a handsome piece of plate on his retirement,
Incledon sang, when requested, his best song, 'The
Storm.' The effect was sublime, the silence holy, the
feeling intense; and while Talma was recovering from
his astonishment, Kemble placed his hand on the arm
of the great French actor, and said in an agitated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
emphatic, and proud tone, '<i>That</i> is an English singer.'"
Marsden adds that Talma jumped up from his seat and
embraced him.</p>

<p>Incledon sang with great feeling, and in "The
Storm" he was able to throw his whole heart into the
ballad, for not only had he encountered many a storm
at sea, but he had been shipwrecked on a passage from
Liverpool to Dublin, on the bar. Some of those on
board were lost, but he saved himself and his wife by
drawing her up to the round-top and lashing her and
himself to it. From this perilous position, after a
duration of several hours, they were rescued by some
fishermen who saw the wreck from the shore.</p>

<p>Incledon belonged in town to "The Glee Club,"
composed of Shield, Bannister, Dignum, himself, and
one or two others. It met on Sunday evenings during
the season at the Garrick Coffee House, in Bow Street,
once a fortnight. At one of these little gatherings
Incledon was amusingly hoaxed. Though an admirable
singer, he was a shockingly bad actor. When he
came in one of the party informed him that an intended
musical performance for a charitable purpose, in which
he, Incledon, was to sing, had been abandoned, on
account of the Bishop of London objecting to an
actor performing in church. Incledon, who was an
extremely irritable man, broke out in a violent strain,
conceiving the word <i>actor</i> to have been employed as a
term of reproach, and addressing himself to Bannister,
said with great vehemence, "There, Charles, do you
hear that?" "Why," said Bannister, "if I were
you, I'd make his lordship <i>prove his words</i>."</p>

<p>Incledon one day was at Tattersall's, when Suett,
the actor, also happened to be there, and asked him
whether he had come to buy a horse. "Yes," said
Charles, "I have. I must ride, it is good for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
health. But why are you here, Dickey? Do you think
that you know the difference between a horse and an
ass?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the comedian. "If you were
among a thousand horses, I would know you immediately."</p>

<p>There was a public-house in Bow Street called
"The Brown Bear," which was famous for a compound
liquor, a mixture of beer, eggs, sugar, and brandy.
Incledon and Jack Johnstone were partial to this, and
frequently indulged themselves with it during the
evening at the theatre, and, as a jest, occasionally
obtained it in the following manner. When there
happened to be several ladies of the theatre in the
green-room, they took that opportunity to represent to
them the hard case of the widow of a provincial actor,
left with her children in great distress, and to solicit
from them a few shillings to enable them to purchase
some <i>flannel</i> during that inclement season. Having
obtained contributions, they despatched the dresser to
"The Brown Bear" for a quart of egg-hot, and had
the modesty not to drink it all themselves, but to
present a glass to each of the females who had subscribed,
requesting them to drink to the health of the
widow and the flannel. When Incledon and Johnstone
had practised this trick several times, Quick, the
comedian of the same theatre, bribed the dresser to
infuse into the mixture a dose of ipecacuanha, and
that brought the joke to an end. But the mixture
thenceforth, without the last ingredient, was popularly
called Flannel.</p>

<p>Incledon was a notoriously vain man. Vanity was
his besetting sin. "In pronouncing his own name,"
says Mr. Matthews, "he believed he described all that
was admirable in human nature. It would happen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
however, that this perpetual veneration of self laid him
open to many effects which, to any man less securely
locked and bolted in his own conceit, would have
opened the door to his understanding. But he had no
room there for other than what it naturally contained;
and the bump of content was all-sufficient to fill the
otherwise aching void. Incledon called himself the
'English Ballad Singer' <i>per se</i>; a distinction he would
not have exchanged for the highest in the realm of
talent. Among many self-deceptions arising out of his
one great foible, he was impressed with the belief that
he was a reading man."</p>

<p>One day Matthews found him in his house deep in
study. Incledon looked up at his visitor, and said,
"My dear Matthews, I'm improving my mind. I'm
reading a book that should be in the hands of every
father and husband."</p>

<p>"What is it, Charles?" asked Matthews, and leaning
over him saw that it was a volume of the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i>!</p>

<p>It had become a habit, during a fagging run of a new
opera at Covent Garden Theatre one season, for certain
performers to club a batch or so of Madeira, of
which they took a glass to their dressing-rooms. Incledon
was continually finding fault with the quality,
and praising up his own private stock of the same wine.
At the close of the season, his brother actors had become
weary of Incledon's grumbling over the Madeira,
which they knew to be excellent. One night a fellow-actor,
seeing a large key lying upon Incledon's dressing-table,
labelled "<i>Cellar</i>," and Incledon happening
at the time to be engaged on the stage till the end
of the opera, despatched the dresser to Brompton
Crescent with the key, with a request to Mrs. Incledon
from her husband that she would send one dozen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
his best Madeira by the bearer. Mrs. Incledon,
wholly unsuspicious of any trick, did so. When
Incledon left the stage, the confederates told him that
they had got fresh and very first-rate Madeira now, as
he had disliked what had been provided before. Incledon
took a glass, made a wry face, took another,
and said, "Beastly stuff! Never in my life tasted such
cheap, vile stuff."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Incledon, you do not appreciate <i>your own</i>
Madeira."</p>

<p>Incledon drank pretty heavily, but did not get drunk.
Here is a bill for a slight evening collation at the
Orange Coffee House, for him and two friends:</p>

<p>Parke, in his <i>Musical Memoirs</i>, relates an instance of
Incledon's selfishness. He says of him that he was a
singular compound of contrarieties, amongst which
frugality and extravagance were conspicuous. "Mr.
Shield the composer, Incledon, and I, lived for many
years a good deal together. On one occasion Shield
and myself dined with Incledon at his house in Brompton
in the month of February. When I had arrived
there, Incledon said to me, 'Bill, do you like ducks?'
Conceiving, from the snow lying on the ground, that
he meant wild ones, I replied, 'Yes, I like a good wild
duck very well.' 'D&mdash;&mdash; wild ducks!' said he: 'I
mean tame ducks, my boy'; adding, 'I bought a couple
in town for which I gave eighteen shillings.' Soon
afterwards a letter arrived, announcing that Mr. Raymond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the stage-manager of Drury Lane Theatre, who
was to have been of the party, could not come; in
consequence of which, I presume, only one duck was
placed on the dinner table, with some roast beef, etc.
When Mrs. Incledon (who, as well as her husband,
was fond of good living) had carved the duck, like a
good wife she helped her husband to the breast part
and to one of the wings, taking at the same time the
other wing to herself, reserving for Shield and me the
two legs and the back. Shield, who looked a little
awkward at this specimen of selfishness and ill-manners,
at first refused the limb offered to him, and I had
declined taking the other: there appeared to be but a
poor prospect of the legs walking off, till Shield relented
and took one, and Incledon the other, so that
they were speedily out of sight. The back, however,
remained behind, and afforded a titbit for the
servants."</p>

<p>On another occasion he was giving a dinner party,
and a dish was brought to table heaped up, apparently,
with fresh herrings. All the company, except Incledon
and his wife, partook of these fish; some were
helped a second time. When the herrings had been
cleared away, there appeared beneath one fine white
fish. "My dear," said Incledon, "what can that be?"
"I believe it is a John Dory, Charles."</p>

<p>Some of the John Dory was offered to the company,
but they had eaten enough fish, and so Incledon and
his wife ate the John Dory between them.</p>

<p>Incledon, whilst very willing to hoax others, was
easily taken in himself. As his dependence was entirely
on his voice, he was very apprehensive of catching
cold, which, in consequence, rendered him the occasional
dupe of quackery.</p>

<p>During Mr. Kemble's management of Covent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Garden Theatre, one of the wags among his fellow-actors
informed him that a patent lozenge had just been
invented and sold only at a jeweller's in Bond Street,
which was an infallible cure for hoarseness. In order
that he might the more readily take the bait, he was
told that Kemble made frequent use of it. Incledon
immediately inquired of the great actor, who very
gravely answered, "Oh, yes, Charles; the patent
lozenge is an admirable thing. I have derived the
greatest benefit from it, when I kept it in my mouth all
night."</p>

<p>Incledon accordingly went to Bond Street to purchase
the valuable lozenge, and the man, who had been
previously instructed, gave him a small pebble in a
pill-box. Incledon arrived at the theatre next day with
the stone in his mouth and spitting frequently. He
was, of course, asked if the patent lozenge did him any
good. "Yes," replied he, spitting; "I kept it in my
mouth (spitting) all night, and (spitting again) it
has this remarkable property, that it does not dissolve,"
and he spat again. The wag requested to see it, and
the production of the pebble provoked a general laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, Charles," said Kemble, "this is a stone! I
meant a patent lozenge. You should have gone to an
apothecary's and not to a jeweller's for it."</p>

<p>Incledon, when he found that he was hoaxed, was
full of wrath; his anger, however, soon subsided.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I can't grumble, for an apothecary
who pretended to have supplied the jeweller with
the lozenge, and who has received from me a letter
belauding the nostrum, has undertaken in return to
dispose of forty pounds' worth of tickets for my
benefit."</p>

<p>On the occasion of this, or some other benefit, he could
not refrain from going every morning to the box-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
to see how many places were taken; and a week before
the last, observing the names to be few besides those of
his own private friends, he said to the box-keeper,
Brandon, "D&mdash;&mdash; it, Jem, if the nobility don't come
forward, I shall cut but a poor figure this time."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said Brandon; "I dare say we
shall do a good deal for you to-day."</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Incledon, "and as I go home to
dinner I will look in again."</p>

<p>Incledon, who was not very familiar with <i>Debrett's
Peerage</i>, returning at five o'clock in the afternoon,
hastened to the book, and read aloud the following
fictitious names, which Brandon, by way of a joke,
had put down in his absence: "The Marquis of
Piccadilly," "The Duke of Windsor."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" exclaimed Incledon, "that must be one
of the Royal Family."</p>

<p>"Lord Highgate"&mdash;"The Bishop of Gravesend."
"Well," said he to Brandon, quite delighted, "if we
get on as well to-morrow as we have to-day, I shall
have a number of distinguished titles present."</p>

<p>Parke says of him: "Amongst other singularities,
Incledon was restless, and could not stay long in a
place. Having, with his wife, dined at my house, in
the evening, whilst the party were engaged at cards,
he absented himself for a considerable time; and, Mrs.
Incledon noticing it particularly, I was induced to go
and look for him. Tracing him by his voice, I found
him in the kitchen, helping the maids to pick parsley,
which was preparing for supper."</p>

<p>Parke adds: "As a ballad singer he was unrivalled,
and his manner of singing sea songs, particularly
Gay's 'Black-eyed Susan,' 'The Storm,' by Alexander
Stevens, and Shield's 'Heaving of the Lead,'
can only be appreciated by those who have heard him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>"Though he evinced a strong propensity to wine,
he never appeared to be intoxicated by it. Dining
with a party at his house, where he had just recovered
from a very severe indisposition, and was, as he said,
advised by his physician to be very abstemious, he
sometimes after dinner, while his friends were drinking
port wine, had a second black bottle placed before him,
which I conceived to contain some very light beverage
suited to his case, till he said to me in an under tone,
'Bill, take a glass of this,' pointing to his black bottle,
which I did, and found it to be Madeira."</p>

<p>During the summer Incledon made provincial tours,
giving entertainments moulded on those of Dibdin,
and these were very successful financially.</p>

<p>After quitting Covent Garden he performed at concerts
and in minor theatres. In 1817 he sailed for
America, where he was received with great enthusiasm,
and realized handsome profits.</p>

<p>His last appearance in London was under Ellison at
Drury Lane in 1820, and his last appearance on any
stage was at Southampton, where he had first appeared
behind the footlights. This was on October 20th in
the same year. He resided towards the end of his days
at Brighton, where he was afflicted with a slight
paralytic affliction, from the effects of which he recovered;
and in February, 1826, being at Worcester,
he experienced a second attack, which proved fatal,
and he died on February 14th in the sixty-eighth year
of his age. His remains were conveyed from Worcester
to Highgate, where they were interred.</p>

<h2>THE MURDER OF RICHARD
CORYTON</h2>


<p>Richard Coryton, eldest son of Peter
Coryton of West Newton Ferrers, in the
parish of S. Mellion, had married Ann,
daughter of Richard Coode, of Morval, and
by her had three sons, Peter, Richard, and John.</p>

<p>Peter, the grandfather, died on 24th March, 1551,
but his son Richard died a violent death in a tragic
manner in 1565. Peter, the younger and heir apparent,
was intent on marrying Jane, the daughter
of John Wrey, of Northrussell, but for some reason
unexplained his father Richard took a violent dislike
to the proposed daughter-in-law, and when his
son persisted in desiring to have her as his wife, the
father flew into a violent passion and swore that if he
took her he would disinherit him of all the lands he
could, and would give to him only a younger son's
portion, constituting Richard head of the family.</p>

<p>Peter remained firm&mdash;he was then in London at the
Court, and the father at once made ready to leave
Newton Ferrers and take his journey to London and
disinherit his son if he found that the marriage was
still insisted on. But on the eve of his starting, as he
was walking in the grounds of Newton Ferrers, he was
suddenly fallen upon by two scoundrels named Bartlett
and Baseley, who owed him a grudge over some matter
that is not mentioned, and they cut his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartlett and Baseley were apprehended and brought
to Launceston before the sheriff, Mr. Trevanion, and
were found guilty; but he could not believe that they
were revenging some private wrong, and as the matter
of dispute between father and son was well known, and
it was known as well that Richard was about to disinherit
his eldest son, a strong suspicion was entertained
by Trevanion that the murder had been committed at
the instigation of the son, and he gave the men
hopes of a reprieve&mdash;if not of a pardon&mdash;if they would
reveal the name of the man who had urged them to
commit this dreadful crime. He behaved, it must be
seen, in a most unfair manner, hinting his suspicions
to the two wretches and giving them no peace till they
declared that they had been set on by Mr. Peter Coryton
to murder his father.</p>

<p>As Peter Coryton was in town, the two criminals
were sent to Newgate to be confronted with him there.
Whether he was arrested on the charge of having
instigated the murder of his father does not appear,
but it is probable.</p>

<p>However, if that were the case, his detention was not
for long, as both murderers recanted when in London.
The following curious deed of "Evidence concerning
the murder of Mr. Coryton" is preserved in Pentillie
Castle.</p>

<p>"To all true Xtian people to whom this present
writing shall come, or shall see, hear or read, Sir
Richard Champion, Knt., Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen
of the City of London send greeting in our Lord
God everlasting.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch as among other, the great and manifold
deeds and works of piety and charity, the witnessing
and declaration of the truth of all matters in
question, ambiguity or doubt is not to be accounted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
least, but rather as a choice virtue and means whereby
the truth, tho' many times suppressed for a season,
doth the rather appear brought forth into the sight and
knowledge of men is with the choicest to be embraced,
extolled, and commended.</p>

<p>"We therefore, the said Lord Mayor and Aldermen,

unto Newgate, and there to examine one Rafe Bartlett,

sick and like to die, to the intent to understand of him
whether one Peter Curryngton, whom before he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
accused for the murder of his own father, were culpable
therein or no. Whereupon this examinate went to the
said gaol of Newgate, and by the way he did meet
with two ministers, the one named Edward Wilkinson,
and the other John Brown, whom he desired to go
with him, who went with him accordingly, and coming
to the aforesaid gaol of Newgate, he desired the keeper
that they might talk with the said Bartlett, and the
said keeper went down with them into the prison, and
brought them unto him, and there finding him very
sore sick, persuaded with him, for that he was more
like to die than live, in discharge of his conscience,
as he would answer before God, to declare unto them
whether that the aforesaid Peter Curryngton, whom
he had accused to be privy and procurer of him and
one Baseley to do the same murder were true Yea
or No.</p>

<p>"Whereupon he confessed and said that he had most
untruly accused the said Peter Curryngton, for he was
never privy, nor knew of it, but that it was he himself
and the said Baseley, without the knowledge of any
other, and declared the cause why they had so accused
him was, for that after they were found guilty for the
same matter, the Sheriff of Cornwall did examine them
if there were any other privy or procuring to the same
murder; and they agreed together to the intent to preserve
their lives, or at the least to prolong the same,
falsely to accuse the said Peter Curryngton; and the
same Bartlett showed himself very sorry and repentant
for his said accusation, saying, 'Think you that Mr.
Curryngton will forgive me?'</p>

<p>"And this examinate answered him, 'There is no
doubt he will, for otherwise he is not of God.' Wherewith
he seemed to be satisfied. And this examinate saith
that the said Bartlett died within two or three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
after; and going from him up the stairs, he, the examinate
and the others were brought unto the aforesaid
Baseley, who confessed and declared unto them in
everything the innocency of the said Peter Curryngton,
concerning the same murder, and that it was he and the
said Bartlett that committed the same without the knowledge
or consent of any other; and that they did
accuse him for the purpose afore alleged, by the said
Bartlett, and more in effect this examinate cannot say.</p>

<p>"<i>Edward Wilkinson</i> of London, Clerk, Parson of the
parish church of S. Antonine in London, aged 33 years
or thereabout, deposed, sworn and examined, the said
day and year hereunder written, saith and deposeth
upon his oath, about November last, the exact time the
examinate remembereth not, he did meet one Mr.
Philpott, parson of S. Michael in Cornhill, in Cheapside,
who desired this examinate that he would go
back with him to Newgate, who did so, and by the way
as they went, they met with Master Brown, a minister,
who likewise went with them to Newgate, and the
deposition of the foresaid Mr. Philpott, being unto
him read, and he, well perusing and understanding the
same, saith and deposeth that all the matter declared
and spoken by the said Bartlett, as it is contained in
the deposition of the said Master Philpott, is very true
in all things, and was spoken in the presence and
hearing of this examinate, and further, this examinate
saith that the words likewise spoken and declared by
the said Baseley, named in the said deposition of the
said Master Philpott, are likewise very true, and were
in the presence and hearing of this examinate. And
further, this examinate saith that he did persuade and
exhort the said Baseley, saying unto him, 'Take good
heed that you do not lie. You have already murdered
one, you have falsely accused another, and you seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
slander the Sheriff (of Cornwall).' And the said Baseley
answered, 'The truth is, Master Sheriff bade me devise
some way to save myself, and I said I could not tell
how,&mdash;and he said the way (to do so) was to accuse some
other. And he examined me whether there was any one
privy or procuring the said murder, beside ourselves,
saying unto me, "You could not do it alone. There be
divers of the Curryngtons. Was there none of them
privy or consenting to the same? You are best to
advise and consider yourself, for the telling the truth
in accusation of others, might be the way to save their
(i.e. your own) lives." Whereupon I returned to the
said Bartlett and conferred with him, and we did agree
together falsely to accuse Peter Curryngton, for the
saving of our own lives'; which accusation was untrue,
and that the said Peter Curryngton was very ignorant
and innocent of the same murder; and that he was sorry
and did repent that he had accused him untruly. And
more he cannot say.</p>

<p>"<i>Edmund Marner</i>, citizen of London and keeper
of the Gaol of Newgate, aged forty-five years or thereabout,
deposed, etc. ... saith and deposeth upon his oath
that the 15th day of November last past, being Saturday,
John Philpott, clerk, etc., Edward Wilkinson and John
Brown, ministers, came to the gaol of Newgate from
the Sheriff of London, by a token, to this examinate,
to speak with one Rafe Bartlett, prisoner there, being
very sore sick."</p>

<p>The deposition of the gaoler was merely a confirmation
of what had been deposed by the two previous
witnesses.</p>

<p>"<i>William Margytte</i>, of London, Clerk, Reader of
the Morning Prayer in the Parish of S. Sepulchre,
and Ordinary for the Bishop of London, of the gaol
of Newgate, aged forty years, deposed, sworn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
examined, etc., that about September last past, one
Richard Baseley, then being prisoner in Newgate, and
very sore sick, and like to die, did send for this examinate,
to speak with him, and this examinate coming
unto him, he said, 'This is the cause that I send for
you. I am very sore sick, and more like to die than
to live, and I think I shall not escape this sicknesse,
and if I do, yet I must die for the law, for I and
one of my neighbours did murder Master Curryngton,
which I do not much repent. But the very cause that
I sent for you is to be a means to Peter Curryngton,
his son, whom I have accused to be privy and procuring
of the same murder, that he would forgive me,
for I have falsely accused him. For as I trust to be
saved by Christ, he is utterly ignorant of the same
murder, and there was none privy to the same but he,
the said Baseley himself, and the said Bartlett, who
committed the same.' And this examinate demanded
of him why he did accuse Peter Curryngton. And he
said that the cause was that after they were found
guilty of the murder, Mr. Trevannyon, Sheriff of
Cornwall, came unto and examined him, as to who was
privy to the murder more than they; saying that they
being so simple would not do the same without assistance;
saying further that if he would confess the truth
as to who helped or procured them to do the same, he
would cause his chain to be stricken off, and carry
him home with him at night, and would save his life,
though it cost him (sum illegible), and thereupon in
hope of life he did accuse the said Peter Curryngton
falsely and wrongfully; and thereupon he said he
would take his death. And the examinate, persuading
him and advising him to repent and be sorry for the
murder of the said Curryngton, calling to God heartily
for mercy and forgiveness of the same. Which in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
end with much ado he seemed to be sorry for ... and
also the examinate went into the same gaol at Newgate,
to speak to Roll Bartlett, to understand whether it
were true what the said Baseley had confessed; who
declared unto the examinate, as he should answer
before God, that Peter Curryngton was never privy
nor of consent to the murder of his father, and that
there was none privy or knew it but only he and the
said Baseley; and the cause why they did kill him was
for that he had misused them many ways, and also,
they thought no man would be sorry for his death.
And this examinate demanded of him the cause wherefore
he did accuse the said Peter Curryngton, he
answered, 'The fair promises of the Sheriff, and to
the interest to preserve their lives, or, at least, to prolong
them, was the only cause,' etc.</p>

<p>"In faith and testimony whereof we the said Mayor
and Aldermen,&mdash;the common seal of our office of
Mayoralty of the said city, to these presents, have caused
to be put, written at the said city of London on the 23rd
day of May, 1566, in the eighth year of the reign of our
most gracious and benign Sovereign Lady Elizabeth,
etc., etc."</p>

<p>It would appear that the murdered man had been not
only a dragon in his house, but also in the entire
neighbourhood, oppressing his tenants and disliked
by the gentry. It is hard not to suspect that Sir Hugh
Trevanion of Carhayes, who was then Sheriff of
Cornwall, bore a personal grudge against Peter
Coryton.</p>

<p>Peter, all obstacle to his marriage being removed,
married the lady of his choice, and by her had three
sons and six daughters. He died the 13th August, 1603.</p>

<p>The murderer Baseley died in Newgate, but Bartlett
was sent back to Launceston and there hanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is not the "end of this shocking affair," for
eighty years after the murder, John Coryton, of Probus,
laid claim to the estates of the then John Coryton, of
Newton Ferrers, on the plea that Peter had forfeited
all rights to the inheritance because he had murdered
his father.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the Right Hon. Houses of Parliament, now
sitting at Westminster.</p>

<p style="text-indent:-2em">The Humble Petition of John Coryton of the parish of
Probus, in the County of Cornwall, gent., a great
sufferer for and in his Majesty's cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>Humbly sheweth&mdash;</p>

<p>That yo<sup>r</sup> petitioner was and is the son of Scipio
Coryton, and Scipio was son of John, and John was son
of Richard Coryton, Esq., of West Newton Ferrers
in the said county of Cornwall, who about eighty
years since was most barbarously murdered by two
fellows who were maintained by the said Richard
Coryton, without any cause or hurt to them, and that
the said Richard having three sons, viz. Peter, the
firstborn, Richard the second, John the third, your
petitioner's grandfather. The said Peter his firstborn
would have married with one Mr. Wrey's daughter, to
w<sup>h</sup> his father would not consent, but threatened his
said son that if he should marry with her that he w<sup>d</sup>
disinherit him of all the lands he could. And that he,
the said Peter, his firstborn, should have but a younger
son's portion. The said Peter, his firstborn, insisted in
the same match by continuing his suit to her. Being
at the Court in London, his said father purposing his
journey for London the Thursday following, to effect
his said purpose of disinheriting his said son. The said
Mr. Wrey living about those parts of West Newton
Ferrers. The Tuesday before walking in part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
said barton of West Newton, was set upon by these
two fellows (their names were Bartley and Baselly) and
cruelly murdered by cutting of his throat. The fellows
were taken and the one died in prison, or was made away
with, the other was brought to Launceston and there
hanged without any confession of who set them on.
One of the said Mr. Wrey's sons (viz.) Edmund, was
seen at the place of execution with a black box under his
arm in the sight of the malefactor, who was cast down
without any confession. These murderers being gone,
the said Peter married the said Mr. Wrey's daughter,
and entered as heir on his father's estate with about
£2000 per annum, his said brothers having nothing;
he gave a living to Richard, his said brother, during
his life. But your petitioner's grandfather, knowing of
the wrong done him, would not take his brother's small
pittance, for he always said that he had right to a
greater part of the estate than he would give him.
Your petitioner's grandfather marrying a gentlewoman
who had a small fortune, went to law with his said
brother for his part of the estate, but being not able to
contend with him by reason of his small ability and the
other's greatness, was forced to give over. And he continually
keeped all the estate to the impoverishing of
your petitioner's grandfather, and they that defended
him. And your petitioner's father being not able to
contend with him by reason of his poverty, leaving me,
his son, in like case, being not able any other way to
seek his right, but by petitioning to your Honours;
your petitioner being impoverished and brought very
low by following his Majesty's service all along the war
in England and Ireland, and with His Highness Prince
Rupert in France also, and other parts where your
petitioner received many cruel wounds and many imprisonments,
which I forbare to relate for burden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
trouble to your Honours, your petitioner and his wife
being no longer able to subsist.</p>

<p>"These premises considered, your poor petitioner
humbly begs your Honours that you will be pleased
to call John Coryton, Esq., of West Newton Ferrers,
the possessor of the said estates, before your Honours;
or where your Honours shall think fit, to show cause
why your petitioner hath not an inheritance of his said
father's estate, which hath been so long kept from
him, and his said father, and your petitioner shall
pray, etc."</p>

<h2>SIR JAMES TILLIE, KNT.</h2>


<p>High above the Tamar where it is most tortuous,
and commanding loop upon loop
of this beautiful river, with the blue
bank of Dartmoor standing up in the east
as a rising thundercloud, stands a red-brick tower
upon an elevated platform, that is reached by a flight
of stone steps.</p>

<p>On the east side of this tower is a recess in the thickness
of the wall, with stone benches, and at the back,
high up, is a little window formed of two slits, through
which the interior can be seen only by putting one foot
on the bench and the other on a projecting corbel in
the wall. What is then revealed is an interior open to
the sky, and with a statue of a seated man, life size,
opposite, in wig and lace steenkirk, one hand resting
on his knee and the other on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>There is no door of admission into the tower; a
doorway has been bricked up. Formerly the tower
consisted of two storeys, with a floor above the square
chamber in which is the statue, and a roof over the
upper apartment. But roof and floor have gone.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1907 the walled-up doorway had to
be opened, so that a large tree might be cut down that
had grown in the midst of the tower and threatened it
with injury. No sooner was it bruited about that
access to the interior was to be had than crowds of
visitors came out from Plymouth and Devonport,
expecting to be able to find within some relics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Sir James Tillie, Bart., whose burial-place was the
lower chamber, where now is only to be seen his statue.</p>

<p>Hals says, the spelling modernized: "About the
year 1712 Sir James Tillie died, and, as I am informed,
by his last will and testament obliged his
adopted heir, one Woolley, his sister's son, not only
to assume his name (having no legitimate issue),
but that he should not inter his body after death in
the earth, but fasten it in the chair where he died
with wire&mdash;his hat, wig, rings, gloves, and best
apparel on, shoes and stockings, and surround the
same with an oak chest, box, or coffin, in which his
books and papers should be laid, with pen and ink
also&mdash;and build for the reception thereof, in a certain
field of his lands, a walled vault or grot, to be arched
with moorstone, in which repository it should be laid
without Christian burial; for that, as he said but an
hour before he died, in two years space he would be at
Pentillie again; over this vault his heir likewise was
obliged to build a fine chamber, and set up therein the
picture of him, his lady, and adopted heir, for ever;
and at the end of this vault and chamber to erect a
spire or lofty monument of stone, from thence for
spectators to overlook the contiguous country, Plymouth
Sound and Harbour; all which, as I am told,
is accordingly performed by his heir, whose successors
are obliged to repair the same for ever out of his lands
and rents, under penalty of losing both.</p>

<p>"However, I hear lately, notwithstanding this his
promise of returning in two years to Pentillie, that
Sir James's body is eaten out with worms, and his
bones or skeleton fallen down to the ground from the
chair wherein it was seated, about four years after it
was set up; his wig, books, wearing apparel, also
rotten in the box or chair where it was first laid."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>The lower chamber, not underground, in which Sir
James was seated was not vaulted over as he directed.
The portraits in the upper chamber have been removed
to Pentillie Castle, where they may now be seen.</p>

<p>But, as already intimated, the statue was erected
where the body was, and beneath it is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
This Monument is erected<br />
In Memory<br />
of<br />
S<sup>ir</sup> James Tillie kn<sup>t</sup> who dyed<br />
15 of Nov<sup>r</sup><br />
Anno Domini 1713<br />
And in y<sup>e</sup> 67<sup>th</sup> year of his Age.
</p>

<p>It is thought&mdash;but no evidence exists to show that it
was so&mdash;that the bones of Sir James were collected by
Mary Jemima, the last of the Tillie family and the
heiress who carried Pentillie to the Coryton family
about 1770, and transferred to the churchyard of S.
Mellion. When the chamber was entered recently and
the tree cut down and eradicated, no traces of the dead
man could be found.</p>

<p>Hals, in his MS. <i>History of Cornwall</i>, says: "Pentyley
a hous and church built by one Mr. James Tyley,
son of ... in ye parish of S. Keverne, labourer as
I am inform'd." The father's name was John. "And
was placed by him a servant or horseman to S<sup>ir</sup> John
Coryton, Bart., the Elder, who afterwards by his
assistance learning the inferiour practice of the Lawe
under an Atturney, became his Steward, in which
caracter by his Care and Industry he soon grew Rich,
soe that he marryed Sir Henry Vane's daughter; by
whome he had a good fortune or estate, but noe issue;
at Length after the Death of his Master (1680) he became
a Guardian in Trust for his younger children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Steward to their elder Brother, Sir John, that marryed
Chiverton, whereby he augmented his wealth and fame
to a greater pitch. When, soon after, King James II
came to the Crown, this gentleman by a great sume of
money and false representation of himselfe obtained
the favour of knighthood at his hands, but that Kinge
some short while after beinge inform'd that Mr. Tyley
was at first but a Groome or Horseman to Sir John Coryton,
that he was no Gentleman of Blood or armes, and
yet gave for his Coat-armour the armes of Count Tillye
of Germany, ordered the Heraulds to enquire into this
matter; who findinge this information trew, by the
King's order entered his Chamber at London, tooke
downe those arms, tore others in pieces, and fastened
them all to Horse tayles and drew them through the
streets of London, to his perpetuall Disgrace, and disgraced
him from the dignity of that beinge, and impos'd
a fyne of £500 upon him for so doing, as I am inform'd&mdash;but
alas, maugre all those proceedings, after the death
of his then Master, Sir John Coryton the Younger, not
without suspicion of being poysoned, he soon marryed
his Lady, with whome Common fame said he was too
familiar before, soe that he became possest of her
goods and chattels, and a great Joynture. Whereby
he liveth in much pleasure and comfort in this place,
honour'd of some, lov'd of none; admiring himself for
the Bulk of his Riches and the Arts and Contrivances
by which he gott it&mdash;some of which were altogether unlawfull,
witness his steward, Mr. Elliott, being credited
for a mint and coyning false money for his use; who
on notice thereof forsooke this Land, and fled beyond
the Seas, though the other Agent and Confederate,
Cavals Popjoye, indicted for the same crime of High
Treason committed at Saltash, was taken, tryed and
found guilty and executed at Lanceston, 1695, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
tyme the writer of these Lynes was one of the Grand
Jury for the body of this County, that found those
Bills&mdash;when William Williams of Treworgy in Probus
Esq. was sheriff, and John Waddon, Esq., foreman of
the Jury."</p>

<p>After this, written at a later date, comes the passage
relative to the burial arrangements of Sir James,
already quoted.</p>

<p>With regard to the above statement, a few remarks
may be made. Sir John Coryton died in 1680, just
after he had obtained a licence for concluding a second
marriage with Anne Wayte, of Acton, widow.</p>

<p>His son, Sir John, married Elizabeth, daughter and
co-heiress of Sir Richard Chiverton, Kt., Lord Mayor
of London, and a wealthy skinner. Sir James Tillie's
first wife was Margaret, daughter of Sir Harry Vane,
the Parliamentarian, who was executed in 1662. Tillie
was knighted at Whitehall, 14th January, 1686-7, and
he built Pentillie Castle. In one of the quadrangles of
the castle is a leaden statue of the knight with flowing
wig, a roll of papers in one hand like the baton of a
field-marshal, and with preternaturally short legs.</p>

<p>In Luttrell's <i>Brief Relation of State Affairs</i> there is
some mention of the affair of the assumed arms. He
says, under date November 26th, 1687: "Sir James
Tillie of Cornwall was brought up upon an habeas
corpus, being committed by the Court of Chivalry for
refusing to find bail there, and was remanded.</p>

<p>"January 19th, 1687-8. The Court of Chivalry satt,
and fined Sir James Tilly £200 for his crime."</p>

<p>Hals, accordingly, was wrong in saying that he was
fined £500.</p>

<p>Hals thinks (he does no more) that Sir James was
mixed up in the coining business. If he got rich by
nefarious practices, it was probably by filling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
pockets out of the Coryton estates, of which he was
steward under two of the baronets.</p>

<p>Sir James Tillie's will by no means carries with it
the character of impiety attributed to it by Hals. It is
headed: "Dei voluntas fiat, et mei hac performet." In
it he mentions the date of his birth, November 16th,
1645. It is a very long will, and in it he laboured
in every conceivable way to found a family. As he
had no children of his own, he made his eldest nephew
heir, but in the event of his dying without issue, then
his estates passed to his second, and so on. At the end
he wrote: "I desire my Body may have a private interment
at and in such a place in Pentillie Castle as I have
acquainted my dearest wife, the Lady Elizabeth Tillie,
with, and to have such monument erected and inscription
thereon made as I have desired my said wife."</p>

<p>The paper of instructions left with her is still extant;
of that more presently. He proceeds: "Although I
have made a provision for my said wife out of my
Lands, yet in regard to her kindness to me whilst
living, and that tenderness to my memory which I know
she will have after my death, for the uses hereinafter
mentioned, I give and bequeath unto my said wife all
her Paraphaanalia [<i>sic</i>], apparell, jewells and ornaments
of her Person, all the Books, China, Portraits and
Toyes in her Closett at Pentillie Castle, my Coach,
Chariott, Calash and set of six horses with two such of
my other Horses and Cowes as shall please her to elect,
and also a Hundred Guineas in money for her life and
then for her grandchildren.</p>

<p>"To Altmira Tillie go the £500 payable on the day
of marriage with either one of my said nephews. But
on her marriage with any other my will is that she shall
have only £250.</p>

<p>"To my Cousin Mary Mattock £50 to be paid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
her marriage Day with any other than William Parkes,
but on her marriage with him this legacy is to be void.</p>

<p>"<i>Then</i> I give unto my said Wife fifty pounds for my
ffunerall desireing four of my ancientest workmen may
lay me in my grave, unto whom I give fforty shillings
apiece. And to William Trenaman ten pounds. And
to my honest Richard Lawreate in Meate and Drink
for his owne person to the value of Two shillings and
sixpence per weeke at Pentillie during his Life. To my
domestique servants living with me at my Death fforty
shillings each, To Samuel Holman his Tooles, and to
John Long a joynt of Mutton weekly during his Life, as
I have done. In witness thereof I have hereunto sett my
hand and seal this 22nd day of March, 1703/4, etc."</p>

<p>One very curious and most unusual feature in the
proving of this will was that the original was handed
over to James Tillie, the nephew, in place of an attested
copy, and only a copy retained in the Consistory Court.</p>

<p>As Sir James had no right to bear arms, his nephew,
James Tillie, obtained a grant from the Heralds' College,
November 1st, 1733. The arms given him were as
follows: <i>Arg., a cross fleury gules, in chief three eagles'
heads couped, sable</i>; and as a crest, on a wreath of the
colours, <i>a demi-ph&#339;nix rising out of flames ppr. and
charged on the breast with a cross fleury sa</i>.</p>

<p>The memorandum referred to by Sir James in his
will, containing instructions as to his burial, is still
extant, and it is by no means as extravagant as represented
by Hals.</p>

<p>Gilpin, in his <i>Observations on the West Parts of
England</i>, 1798, gave currency to the story as amplified
by tradition, and thenceforth it was generally accepted
and obtained currency.</p>

<p>Gough, in his Camden's <i>Britannia</i>, 1789, says: "In
the rocks of Whitsand Bay, Tilly, Esq., who died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
about fifty years ago, remarkable for the freedom of
his principles and life, was inclosed by his own order,
dressed in his clothes, sitting, his face to the door
of a summer-house at Pentelly, the key put under the
door, and his figure in wax, in the same dress and
attitude in the room below."</p>

<p>Gough makes several mistakes. Pentillie is a great
many miles from Whitsand Bay, and he was placed
not among rocks, but on the summit of a hill called
Ararat. The figure carved in the attitude in which
placed to rest is in sandstone, and not in wax; and
finally it is not in a summer-house, but in a lofty brick
tower, erected after his death, the bill for the erection
of which is still in existence.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his schemes to found a family,
his posterity failed in the male line, and the castle and
Tillie lands passed as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an illustrious and ancient family of Tilly,
or Tylly, at Cannington, in Somersetshire, deriving
from a De Tilly in the reign of Henry II, and the parish
of West Harptree in the same county is divided into
two manors, one of which is West Harptree-Tilly.
The arms of this Tilly family were only a dragon erect,
<i>sable</i>, and as such appear in glass in the windows of
Cannington Church.</p>

<p>That Sir James Tillie could claim no descent from
this family is evident from his not assuming their arms.
Had the Heralds been able to trace any connection
whatever, they would have given to the nephew a
coat resembling the Tilly arms of Cannington but
not identical.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the possession of a
surname of a noble or gentle family by no means indicates
that the bearer had a drop of that family's blood
in his veins; for it was quite a common thing when
surnames began to be acquired for the domestic servants
in a house to be called after their master, or that they
should assume their patronymics, much as in <i>High
Life Below Stairs</i> the menial servants assume the
titles of their masters as well as their names. This
practice was so common that always in the neighbourhood
of a great house, that has lived on through many
centuries, will be found among the villagers in a very
humble walk of life persons bearing the surname of
the illustrious family in the castle, the hall, or the
manor. How a dependent of the Tilly family of Cannington
drifted down to the Lizard is not easily explained;
it may be that this Tilly was descended from
one of the regiments that Charles I sent down to the
Scilly Isles, and which was left there and forgotten.</p>

<h2>LIEUTENANT JOHN HAWKEY</h2>


<p>Joseph Hawkey, of Liskeard, and his wife
Amye, daughter of the Rev. John Lyne, had
a numerous family. John was the eldest son,
born at Liskeard in 1780; the other sons were
William, Joseph, Richard, and Charles. There was also
a daughter Charlotte, born at Liskeard 10th May, 1799.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Joseph Hawkey, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span>, born at Liskeard in
1786, was killed in action while commanding a successful
attack on a Russian flotilla in the Gulf of Finland
in 1809.</p>

<p>John also entered the navy, as midshipman in the
<i>Minerva</i>. A few months after the renewal of the war
in 1803 he was taken prisoner whilst gallantly defending
that ship, when she was unfortunately run by the pilot,
during a dense fog, on the west point of the stone
dyke of Cherbourg. Hawkey remained in captivity
at Verdun for eleven years, till 1814.</p>

<p>A commission of lieutenant had been sent out to him
by mistake to the West Indies, which being dated
previous to his capture was not cancelled, but forwarded
to him in France, and was thus the means in some
degree of alleviating the evils of captivity. Whilst
at Verdun he made the acquaintance of Lieutenant
Tuckey, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span>, a person like himself a prisoner, and
like him of fine taste and considerable talents.</p>

<p>His prospects had been cruelly clouded by his long
detention in captivity, and on the conclusion of peace
he at once joined the <i>Cyrus</i>, sloop of war; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
the Government proposed to send out an expedition to
explore the Zaire or Congo, and appointed Tuckey in
command, Lieutenant Hawkey eagerly accepted the
invitation of his friend to join him and act as second
in command.</p>

<p>At this time little was known of the Congo and the
Niger. Hitherto what was known was due to Arabian
writers of the Middle Ages, and to what leaked out
from the Portuguese; but these latter, who carried on
an extensive slave trade thence, did their utmost to
keep their knowledge of these rivers to themselves.
But even they were not well acquainted with the rivers
far up from their mouths. Mungo Park was preparing
for his second expedition to explore the Niger, and it
was even supposed that the Congo or Zaire that flows
into the South Atlantic was an outlet of the Niger, and
not an independent river; and this opinion was warmly
expounded by Park in a memoir addressed to Lord
Camden previous to his departure from England, and
he added that, if this should turn out to be a fact, "considered
in a commercial point of view, it is second only
to the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope; and, in a
geographical point of view, it is certainly the greatest
discovery that remains to be made in this world."</p>

<p>On March 19th, 1816, the <i>Congo</i>, accompanied by the
<i>Dorothy</i> transport, sailed on a voyage of exploration to
the Zaire. The <i>Congo</i> was about ninety tons, schooner
rigged, and drew five feet of water. She was fitted up
entirely for the accommodation of officers and men,
and for the reception of the objects of natural history
which might be collected on her progress up the river.
The gentlemen engaged on the expedition, in the
scientific department, were: Professor Smith, of Christiania,
botanist and geologist; Mr. Tudor, comparative
anatomist; Mr. Cranch, collector of objects of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
history; and a gardener to gather plants and seeds for
Kew; also Mr. Galway, a gentleman volunteer. There
were two negroes, who would serve as interpreters,
one of whom came from eight hundred miles up
the Zaire. The officers were: Captain Tuckey,
Lieutenant Hawkey, Mr. Fitzmaurice, master and surveyor,
Mr. McKernow, assistant surgeon, two master's
mates, and a purser. In addition to the <i>Congo</i>, the
transport took out two double whale-boats, so fitted as
to be able to carry eighteen to twenty men, with three
months' provisions.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hawkey was an excellent draughtsman;
he sketched in a bold and artistic manner, and to a
general knowledge of natural history he united the
talent of painting the minutest sea and land animals
with great spirit and accuracy.</p>

<p>Although the vessels sailed from Deptford on
February 16th, they were detained in the Channel and
at Falmouth by westerly gales till March 19th. On
April 9th they reached the Cape de Verd Islands,
whence he wrote home to his sister Charlotte:&mdash;</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Porto Praya, S. Jago</span>, <i>August 11th, 1816</i>.
</p>

<p>"My Angel,&mdash;I am just able to hold my pen and
tell you that I am alive, after being as near death as
ever mortal being was. The day before yesterday we
arrived here. Captain Tuckey and myself went to
wait on the governor, the commissary, and captain
of the transport, to procure refreshments. We were
graciously received&mdash;saluted by his black guards&mdash;took
a walk in the country&mdash;returned, intending to go
on board to dinner. There is a heavy surf on the
beach, and squalls are very frequent from the mountains;
one of which, when we were about a cable's
length from the shore, upset our boat. I intended
swimming composedly on shore, but something or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
some person caught my leg, and I could not by any
exertion get my head above water. It instantly struck
me that some one who could not swim had seized me,
hoping to save himself; and I swam in what I conceived
to be the direction of the shore, under water.
My senses I preserved as fully as at present. O Lord,
methought, what pain it was to drown! What dreadful
noise of water in my ears! I thought my last hour
was come. Still I struggled violently, but finding it
impossible to retain my breath longer, I took off my
hat and held it above the water. A black boy, who
had swam off with several other, got hold of it, and
then of me. From that moment all recollection ceased
until I found myself with my stomach on an empty cask
on the beach, surrounded by my own party and blacks.
My sufferings were very acute; the absolute pain of
dying&mdash;which ceremony I completely underwent&mdash;was
nothing in comparison. The different means prescribed
for the recovery of drowned persons were used;
and as soon as possible I was conveyed on board.
A determination of blood to the head and lungs took
place; all night I was in danger; but it is now going
fast off, but I am in a state of absolute debility. Captain
Tuckey says I was more than five minutes under
water&mdash;a longer time than the most experienced divers
can remain. Note, I was in full uniform&mdash;boots,
sword&mdash;and my pockets full of stones and shells I had
picked up on shore. Captain Tuckey lost his sword;
his watch and mine are both spoiled."</p>

<p>Cape Padrone, at the mouth of the Congo, was
reached on July 6th. The transport was left a little
way up, and the party of exploration pushed on up
the river. The mouth of the Congo was found to be
about fifteen miles wide. Far inland were seen naked
hills of sand. Professor Smith wrote in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>"July 7th.&mdash;Early this morning the mafock, or
governor, came on board in two canoes, with his
retinue. At first his pretensions were very lofty. He
insisted on being saluted with a discharge of cannon,
and on observing us going to breakfast declared that
he expected to be placed at the same table with the
captain, and endeavoured to make his words sufficiently
impressive by haughty gesticulations. Sitting on the
quarter-deck in a chair covered with a flag, his dress
consisting of a laced velvet cloak, a red cap, a piece
of stuff round his waist, otherwise naked, with an
umbrella over his head, though the weather was cold
and cloudy, he represented the best caricature I ever
saw. He soon became more moderate on being informed
that the vessels were not belonging to slave
merchants, but to the King of England, and that our
object was to trade. In order to give him a proof of
our goodwill towards him, a gun was discharged and
a merchant flag hoisted."</p>

<p>A good many negroes after this came on board.
They were nearly all nominally Christians. Among
them was a Catholic priest, who had been ordained at
Loando. He had been baptized two years before his
ordination at S. Antonio.</p>

<p>"The barefooted black apostle, however, had no
fewer than five wives. A few crosses on the necks of
the negroes, some Portuguese prayers, and a few
lessons taught by heart, are the only fruits that remain
of the labours (of the Portuguese missionaries) of
three hundred years."</p>

<p>Proceeding up the river, threading a tangle of
islands and sandbanks, the vessels stood off Embonna,
where they came across an American slaver flying
Swedish colours. Here there had been several Portuguese
slave-dealing ships, but on hearing of the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
in the river of the English vessels during the night
they slipped away.</p>

<p>On July 25th they came to the Fetiche Rock, a mass
of micaceous granite rising perpendicularly out of
the river, with eddies and whirlpools at its feet. The
surface of the rock is covered with sculptured figures,
which Lieutenant Hawkey drew, and which he managed
to interpret.</p>

<p>On July 26th Captain Tuckey and others landed at
Lombee, a village of a hundred huts, and the king's
market, and here they went to visit the chenoo, or
king.</p>

<p>"Having seated myself," wrote Tuckey, "the
chenoo made his appearance from behind a mat-screen,
his costume conveying the idea of Punch in a puppet
show, being composed of a crimson plush jacket with
curious gilt buttons, a lower garment in the native
style in red velvet, his legs muffled in pink sarsenet,
and a pair of red morocco half-boots. On his head an
immense high-crowned hat embroidered with gold,
and surmounted by a kind of coronet of European
artificial flowers. Having seated himself on the right,
a master of the ceremonies with a long staff in his
hand inquired into the rank of the gentlemen, and
seated them accordingly.</p>

<p>"All being seated, I explained to the chenoo, by the
interpreter, the motives of my mission&mdash;stating that
'the King of England being equally good as he was
powerful, and having conquered all his enemies and
made peace in all Europe, he now sent his ships to all
parts of the world to do good to all people, and to see
what they wanted and what they had to exchange; that
for this purpose I was going up the river, and that, on
my return to England, English trading vessels would
bring them the objects necessary to them, and teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
them to build houses and make clothes.' These benevolent
intentions were, however, far beyond their
comprehension; and as little could they be made to
understand that curiosity was also one of the motives
of our visit, or that a ship could come such a distance
for any other purpose but to trade or fight; and for two
hours they rung the changes on the questions, Are you
come to trade? and Are you come to make war? At
last, however, they appeared to be convinced that I
came for neither purpose; and on my assuring them
that though I did not trade myself I should not meddle
with the slave traders of any nation, they expressed
their satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The keg of spiced rum which I had brought as
part of my present to the chenoo was now produced,
together with an English white earthen washhand basin
covered with dirt, into which some of the liquor was
poured and distributed to the company, the king saying
he drank only wine, and retiring to order dinner.
The moment he disappeared, the company began to
scramble for a sup of the rum; and one fellow, dropping
his dirty cap into the basin, as if by accident,
contrived to snatch it out again well soaked, and sucked
it with great satisfaction."</p>

<p>Here Captain Tuckey learned that the traders carried
off on an average two thousand slaves every year.</p>

<p>Hence, on August 5th, Captain Tuckey, Lieutenant
Hawkey, and the scientific gentlemen proceeded up
the river in the double boat, the transport's longboat,
two gigs, and a punt. In addition to those already
mentioned were some of the sailors and the interpreters.</p>

<p>On August 10th the expedition reached Noki, where
the river was rapid and difficult, running between high
bluffs, and Professor Smith likened it to one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
torrent streams of Norway. On reaching Caran Yellatu
progress was arrested by cataracts, and the party
was forced to quit the boats and push on by land.
Here one of the interpreters deserted, carrying away
with him four of the best porters who had been
engaged at Embonna.</p>

<p>"Every man I have conversed with," says Tuckey,
"acknowledges that if the white man did not come for
slaves the practice of kidnapping would no longer
exist, and the wars which nine times out of ten result
from the European slave trade would be proportionately
less frequent. The people at large most assuredly
desire the cessation of a trade in which, on the contrary,
all the great men, deriving a large portion of their
revenue from the presents it produces, as well as the
slave merchants, are interested in its continuance."</p>

<p>At Juga the river again widened, and this was made
a basis for excursions by land up the river.</p>

<p>On the 10th September Captain Tuckey found it
impossible to proceed further; sickness and death were
making terrible ravages among the party, and it
became absolutely necessary to relinquish the enterprise
and endeavour to make their way back to the
vessels. On the following day Captain Tuckey's
journal records that they "had a terrible march&mdash;worse
to us than the retreat from Moscow."</p>

<p>Of this return journey we have an account from
Lieutenant Hawkey's diary. When Sir John Barrow
published an account of the expedition from the journals
of Captain Tuckey and Professor Smith the diary
of Hawkey was not obtainable; it had been lost, and
was not recovered for some years; and then, when given
for publication, was again lost, and only the concluding
pages were to be found. It shall be given, somewhat
curtailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>"September 9th.&mdash;Our Ultima Thule. Sketched
by the setting sun the appearance of the river, a thousand
ideas rushing into my mind: the singularity
of my situation, its contrast with my captivity, and
equally so with my wishes. Here, probably, my
travels are to end; but Heaven knows for what I am
destined, and I resign myself. Passed a sleepless
night, and wandered on the beach, wishing, but in
vain, for sleep. Captain Tuckey ill all night.</p>

<p>"September 10th.&mdash;A fine grey morning. Packing
up for our return&mdash;a great assemblage of natives, one
with a gay red cap. Bought six fowls for an umbrella.
Dr. Smith sketched our last view of the mighty
Zaire. Set out and soon found Dawson very sick;
obliged to give his arms and knapsack to others, and to
lead him and give him wine occasionally. Halted at
Vonke, where I got into a scrape by touching Amaza's
fetiche, for which, it being ruined, he wanted a fathom
of chintz, which I gave him. It is forbidden to touch
a fetiche or to carry fowls with their heads downwards.
Bought a goat for an umbrella. Bargaining for a
canoe for the sick and luggage; procured one, and
embarked poor Dawson. Tuckey ill; at Masakka had
a specimen of African hospitality: Tuckey, fainting
and ill, could not obtain a drop of palm wine until
it was paid for exorbitantly. Peter gave the cap from
his head, and Tuckey his handkerchief and the last
beads. To his being faint they paid not the least
regard. About two miles from Sirndia all our guides
abandoned us. However, we found our way, and on
our arrival the tent and luggage, just landed.</p>

<p>"September 11th.&mdash;Hazy, cloudy; feel a little ill.
Canoes assembling; bargained for two for six fathoms
and four handkerchiefs. A world of trouble with them&mdash;three
strokes of the paddle and stop; wanted to land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
us above the rapid; obliged to threaten to put them
to death. At last got them to a rapid that stopped us,
where we landed and again grumbled on. One fellow
attempted to snatch the piece from Captain Tuckey's
hand. Met here with some of our old friends, and
bargained with the man whose canoe was stove on the
7th to take us to Juga. The bearers are to have two
fathoms each, and himself a dress. Encamped at
Bemba Ganga. Broached our last bottle of wine.</p>

<p>"September 12th.&mdash;A grey morning. Bought four
fowls for two empty bottles, and four more for some
beads. Embarked in a canoe and set off. About ten
arrived at Ganga and had to wait for a canoe; atmosphere
much changed. Hitherto we had found the
blacks honest enough, but here they gave us specimens
of being as great thieves as they were cowards. The
canoe in which the sick men came down was robbed
of some check and baft (coarse cloth). One fellow
attempted to steal a carbine. Ben (the black interpreter)
lost his greatcoat, which the fellow he trusted
with it ran away with, and our barometer was stolen in
the night. Dr. Smith was taken ill here. We encamped
in the valley of Demba, where we were assailed
by ants in myriads, and got no sleep. After dusk we
were informed that the men whom we had hired at
Bemba as canoe men had run away.</p>

<p>"September 13th.&mdash;From 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. no
refreshments excepting earth-nuts, palm-wine, and
water. However, we persevered, and at dusk reached
Juga, where we found Butler sick, and had the misery
of being told that poor Tudor and Cranch were no
more, Galway despaired of, and many of the crew sick.
Melancholy enough, God knows, but hold on. Mansa,
the slave, has deserted with poor Galway's knapsack.</p>

<p>"September 14th.&mdash;Mizzling rain; melancholy morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
The captain and Dr. Smith sick. Packing up
for ship. Hodder sets out with ten men and an advanced
guard. Dr. Smith worse; decide on removing
him to-day; difficulty in getting bearers; prepared
hammocks for the sick. At noon both the captain and
Dr. Smith better; Dawson rather worse; get Butler
into a house. Corporal Middleton arrives with the sad
news of Galway's death, that of poor Stirling and
Berry, and a long list of sick. Here I am in the tent.
Poor Tuckey ill, asleep, or perhaps feigning it to avoid
conversation. Dr. Smith groaning under a rheumatic
fever, and his trusty David Lockhart attending him.
My ideas are wandering round the world, and the only
consolation is that perhaps it may be the means of my
seeing my dear European friends sooner than I had
expected. Five only of the <i>Congo's</i> are capable of duty,
except the warrant officers. Saturday night. God
bless you all, my dear, dear friends!</p>

<p>"September 15th.&mdash;Broke up at Juga, and such a
scene I never before witnessed, and hope never to witness
again. As soon as Tuckey was gone, the natives
rushed in upon us like so many furies, each taking what
he could get hold of; the things we were obliged to
abandon. A part of our guides and bearers ran away
with the things they were to carry, and poor Butler was
obliged to come away with only two bearers, who
tottered under him, and who were mocked by their
compassionate countrymen. I left him near the ravine
of Bondé, and passed on to Dawson, who was coming
on pretty well, as he had four bearers and was not very
heavy. Not far from Vouchin-semnis we were assailed
with horrid shrieks and cries, and soon saw a dozen
women, or rather furies, holding their idols towards us,
rolling their eyes, foaming at the mouth, and making
the most violent contortions. They had lost some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
manioc, and were exorcising the thieves. I believe the
gangam (priest) had accused us of the robbery. We
continued our march, rather a forced one, to Noki.
Far different was the night, and far different our feelings,
on the 23rd of last month! I was colder than charity,
and it rained very hard for more than two hours.</p>

<p>"September 16th.&mdash;Started from Juga. Captain and
party on foot, and Dr. Smith in a hammock. Dr.
Smith very weak; obliged to take him out of his hammock,
and William Burton, a marine, carried him on
his back, up almost precipices, to Banza, where we had
great difficulty in getting a little water, which was
only obtained by the double influence of a threat to
shoot them and a present of some powder. Arrived at
the beach, where we found all in confusion. No
canoes to be had, in consequence of a taboo from the
King of Vinni, who had not received his dues from
Sanquila, who says, on his side, it is in consequence of
the commanding officer of the <i>Congo</i> having threatened
to put some one in irons. Seized the man who appeared
to be the chief cause of the opposition, and at the same
time fired at, brought to, and seized five fishing-canoes,
and shortly after obtained two larger from a creek,
when we liberated three of the fishermen's canoes and
the head-man.</p>

<p>"September 17th.&mdash;Preparing for embarkation. Finding
no paddlers come, pressed two men and set out,
crossing over to the south shore to avoid the whirlpools.
When we left men were assembling fast on the hills,
and told us we had killed a man last night. Beached
the canoes and ate some goat's flesh. So returned on
board and reached the <i>Congo</i>. Found our vessel in a
horrid state of confusion and filth; stuffed with parrots,
monkeys, puppies, pigeons, etc. The carpenter cutting
up the last plank to make coffins. The deck lumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
as when we left her, and not a wind-sail up! No stock
on board; the sick in double boats and tents pitched
on shore. My cabin filthy as a hog-stye. Passed a
sleepless night. Dr. Smith very unwell, and Captain
Tuckey very little better.</p>

<p>"September 18th.&mdash;A little after daylight, Captain
Tuckey, Dr. Smith, and myself left the <i>Congo</i>. Passed
M'Bima. The river is very much risen; eagles hovering
over us all the way down. Arrived on board the
<i>Dorothy</i> at 3 p.m. Got Dr. Smith to bed; refreshed
ourselves, and thought the air here quite reviving, and
a clean ship the greatest of luxuries. All on board the
<i>Dorothy</i> had been well, except the carpenter, who was
convalescent, and a boy who had been up in the longboat,
and was in the same state.</p>

<p>"September 19th.&mdash;Sloop's boat arrived with the
sick, and Johnson dead. Went on shore with Captain
Gunther and some of the transport's people, and buried
him&mdash;so putrid that I was obliged to bury him in his
cot, with all his bedding.</p>

<p>"September 20th.&mdash;Sick improving generally; transport
getting ready for sea. <i>Congo</i> not in sight. Sent
skiff to <i>Congo</i>. At 6 p.m. Garth dies. Skiff returns;
has left <i>Congo</i> near Augsberg Island. Parrots prevent
all possibility of sleeping to the sick.</p>

<p>"September 21st.&mdash;Hazy morning. <i>Congo</i> not in
sight at nine. An order for all parrots to be before the
fore-hatchway. Buried Garth. Durnford and Burton
attacked with fever; Lockhart unwell, and Ben. Two
of transport's people ill. Jefferies, fever; Ben wishes
to remain at M'Bima. At 6 p.m. <i>Congo</i> and schooner
anchored here. Dr. Smith appears to be in a stupor.</p>

<p>"September 22nd.&mdash;Close morning. Getting stores,
etc., from <i>Congo</i>; cleaning her decks; preparing to get
her water-tanks filled. Dr. Smith still in a stupor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Sick generally better, except the captain and Parker.
Weighed with <i>Dorothy</i> and sloop; beat down with sea-breeze.
Dr. Smith, poor fellow, dies, quite worn out;
in some measure from his own imprudent treatment of
himself, constantly refusing to follow the doctor's
advice or to take any medicine; cold water was his
only specific. He died without a groan. Mild, affable,
and learned, it was his greatest pleasure to communicate
information, and to receive it. He had conciliated
the affections of all his fellow-passengers, and even of
all the crews of both vessels. Anchored at dark, sloop
not in sight. Hoisted a light, to be kept up all night.</p>

<p>"September 23rd.&mdash;At night buried the mortal
remains of Dr. Smith, as silently as possible. No
sloop in sight; very uneasy on account of the sick.
Hot weather; sprinkled with vinegar; Tuckey much
better. Sloop arrives; reason of not joining before,
does not beat well.</p>

<p>"September 24th.&mdash;Cloudy morning; small rain.
<i>Dorothy</i> sets up her rigging. Set sail on <i>Dorothy</i>, but
she could not stem the current, which is very strong.
The corporal, Middleton, is the only man out of the
sick list.</p>

<p>"September 25th.&mdash;Cloudy morning; land breeze
until noon. Two bottles of wine were stolen from the
sick last night. <i>Congo</i> in sight, and schooner, the
latter coming up the river; anchored here. Removed
all the sick from the sloop to the <i>Dorothy</i>.</p>

<p>"September 26th.&mdash;Grey morning. Paid our blacks,
and as soon as we weighed turned them adrift in the
large canoe. Weighed and worked round Sharks'
Point; felt quite happy when to the westward of it.
On the 5th July we entered the <i>Congo</i>, and since then
thirteen of our party have died and one has been
drowned. Sick generally better; seventeen on the list.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
Tuckey hailed for assistance previous to our weighing;
talks of giving up charge."</p>

<p>On September 30th Lieutenant Hawkey enters the
death of Lethbridge and of Eyre.</p>

<p>On October 1st enters: "Taken very unwell myself&mdash;universal
debility and slight headache.</p>

<p>"October 2nd.&mdash;Cloudy. Standing to the west all
day. Very unwell.</p>

<p>"October 3rd.&mdash;Cloudy, with swell. Still very
unwell. Swallow caught."</p>

<p>This is the last entry in the diary. On the day
following Captain Tuckey died; and on October 6th
Lieutenant Hawkey's own name was added to the fatal
list of those who perished in this most disastrous expedition.
In all eighteen died in the short space of less
than three months during which they remained in the
river, or within a few days after leaving it. Fourteen
of these were of the party that had set out on the land
journey above Juga; the other four were attacked on
board the <i>Congo</i>; two had died on the passage out, and
the sergeant of marines in the hospital at Bahia,
making the total of deaths amount to twenty-one.</p>

<p>This great mortality is the more extraordinary, as it
appears from Captain Tuckey's journal that nothing
could have been finer than the climate: the atmosphere
was remarkably dry, and scarcely a shower fell during
the whole journey, and the sun for three or four days
did not shine sufficiently to allow of an observation
being taken.</p>

<p>It appears from the report of the assistant surgeon
that the greater number were carried off by a violent
intermittent fever; some of them appeared, however, to
have had no other ailment than that caused by extreme
exhaustion caused by the land journey. Some of the
crew of the <i>Congo</i> died of the fever who never went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
above the cataracts; "but then," as the surgeon
observes, "they were permitted to go on shore at
liberty, where the day was passed in running about the
country, and during the night lying in huts or in the
open air."</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for January, 1817, gives
a brief summary of the achievements of the expedition.
"They arrived at the mouth of the Congo about
the 3rd July, and leaving the transport, which only
accompanied them an inconsiderable distance, they
proceeded in the sloop, which was purposely built to
draw little water, up the river to the extent of 120
miles, when her progress, and even that of the boats,
was stopped by rapids. Determined still to prosecute
the undertaking, the men landed, and it was not till
they had marched 150 miles over a barren, mountainous
country, and after experiencing the greatest
privations from want of water, and being entirely exhausted
by fatigue, that they gave up the attempt.
Hope stayed them up till they reached the vessel, but
they were so worn out that twenty-five out of the fifty-five
died twenty-four hours after their return, comprehending
all the scientific part of those who started, and
only eight were left on board in a state fit to navigate
the vessel."</p>

<p>That there is some inaccuracy in this account will be
seen from what has preceded it.</p>

<p>The authority for the story of this unfortunate expedition
is Sir John Barrow's edition of the narrative
of the expedition, with the diary of Captain Tuckey,
published in 1819; and Miss Charlotte Hawkey's
<i>Neota</i>, privately printed in 1871.</p>

<h2>DR. DANIEL LOMBARD</h2>


<p>Lanteglos with Camelford is one of the
richest livings in Cornwall. Lanteglos itself
is nearly two miles from Camelford, and in
this latter place there is neither a church nor
a licensed chapel. A few scattered farms are about
Lanteglos; and in Camelford, which is a market town,
there is a population of 1370, left to be ministered to
in holy things by dissenting ministers of many sects.</p>

<p>The rectory of Lanteglos lies in a valley, amidst
luxuriant vegetation, and is altogether a very snug
spot indeed.</p>

<p>In February, 1718, the Rev. Daniel Lombard was
inducted into this living on the presentation of the
Prince of Wales. He was a Frenchman, the son of a
Huguenot pastor, who had fled from his native land
on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Daniel
had been placed in Merchant Taylors' School, and
thence had passed to S. John's College, Oxford, where
he had taken his degree of Doctor of Divinity, and he
became chaplain to the Princess of Wales, and in
1714 published a sermon that he had preached before
the Princess Sophia at Hanover. He spent a good
deal of time in Germany, and there made the acquaintance
of Mr. Gregor, of Trewarthenick, with whom in
after life he maintained a lengthy correspondence, still
extant.</p>

<p>From all accounts Dr. Lombard was learned on
certain lines, but he was totally unacquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
ways of the world, utterly unsuited to be a parish
priest, and lost completely in the isolation of Lanteglos,
far from society in which he could shine; and speaking
English badly with a foreign accent.</p>

<p>After his institution by the Bishop of Exeter to the
livings of Lanteglos juxta Camelford and that of
Advent, Dr. Lombard started off to reach his cure,
mounted on one horse, and his servant on another,
driving a third laden with such articles as appeared to
him to be indispensable in a country where he supposed
that nothing was procurable.</p>

<p>He rode in this manner along the highway past
Launceston, inquiring everywhere, "Vere ish Landéglo
juxtà Camélvore?" No one had heard of the
place; after some consideration the rustics pointed due
west. He must go on one or two days' journey more.
He thus travelled through Camelford, still inquiring
"Mais où donc est Landéglo juxtà Camélvore?"</p>

<p>"I know what he means," said some of those questioned;
"the gentleman is seeking the Land's End."</p>

<p>And so he travelled on and ever on till he reached the
Land's End, and only then discovered that he had
passed through his cure without knowing it.</p>

<p>When at last he reached Lanteglos rectory, the woman
who acted as housekeeper showed him with much pride
a hen surrounded by a large brood of chickens.
"Deare me!" exclaimed the Doctor. "'Ow can von
liddle moder afford to give milk from her breast to soche
a large familie?"</p>

<p>Seeing sheep with red ruddle on their fleeces, "Pore
things!" said he. "'Ow 'ot dey do seem to be! Dey be
red 'ot!"</p>

<p>He collected a tolerable library of books, and
occupied himself with writing one work in French, a
Dissertation on the Utility of History, introductory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
strictures on certain histories that had been published
by De Mezeray and the Père Daniel. But he also wrote
in English <i>A Succinct History of Ancient and Modern
Persecutions</i>, together with a short essay on <i>Assassinations
and Civil Wars</i>, 1747.</p>

<p>He died at Camelford, December 14, 1746, and left
his library for the use of his successor.</p>

<h2>THE DREAM OF MR. WILLIAMS</h2>


<p>John Williams, of Scorrier, was the son of
Michael Williams, of Gwennap, and was born
23rd September, 1753. He was the most extensive
mining adventurer in Cornwall.</p>

<p>On May 11, 1812, Mr. Perceval, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, was shot in the evening, just as he entered
the lobby of the House of Commons, by a man called
Bellingham, who had concealed himself behind a door.</p>

<p>On that same night, Mr. Williams, of Scorrier, had
three remarkable dreams, in each of which he saw the
whole transaction as distinctly as if he had been present
there in person.</p>

<p>His attested statement, relative to these dreams, was
drawn up and signed by him in the presence of the
Rev. Thomas Fisher and Mr. Chas. Prideaux Brune.
This account, the original MS. signed by Mr.
Williams, is preserved at Prideaux Place, Padstow.
A very minute account of it found its way into the
<i>Times</i> of the 28th August, 1828; another was furnished
to Dr. Abercrombie derived from Mr. Williams himself,
who detailed his experiences to a medical friend
of the doctor, and this latter published this in his
<i>Inquiries Concerning the Intellectual Power</i>. This was
republished by Dr. Clement Carlyon in <i>Early Years
and Late Reflections</i>, 1836-41, together with another
account by Mr. Hill, a barrister, grandson of Mr. John
Williams, and which he had taken down from his
grandfather's lips. All these accounts are practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
identical. According to Dr. Abercrombie: "Mr.
Williams dreamt that he was in the lobby of the House
of Commons and saw a small man enter, dressed in a
blue coat and white waistcoat. Immediately after he
saw a man dressed in a brown coat with yellow basket
buttons draw a pistol from under his coat and discharge
it at the former, who instantly fell, the blood issuing
from a wound a little below the left breast." According
to Mr. Hill's account, "he heard the report of the pistol,
saw the blood fly out and stain the waistcoat, and saw
the colour of the face change." Dr. Abercrombie's
authority goes on to state: "He saw the murderer seized
by some gentlemen who were present, and observed his
countenance, and in asking who the gentleman was
who had been shot, he was told it was the Chancellor.
He then awoke, and mentioned the dream to his wife,
who made light of it." This wife was Catherine,
daughter of Martin Harvey, of Killefreth, in Kenwyn,
born in 1757.</p>

<p>We will now take the rest of the narrative from the
account in the <i>Times</i>: "Mrs. Williams very naturally
told him it was only a dream, and recommended him
to be composed, and go to sleep as soon as he could.
He did so, and shortly after woke her again, and said
that he had the second time had the same dream;
whereupon she observed he had been so much agitated
by his former dream that she supposed it had dwelt on
his mind, and begged him to try to compose himself and
go to sleep, which he did. A third time the vision was
repeated, on which, notwithstanding her entreaties that
he would be quiet and endeavour to forget it, he arose,
it being then between one and two o'clock, and dressed
himself.</p>

<p>"At breakfast the dreams were the sole subject of
conversation, and in the afternoon Mr. Williams went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
to Falmouth, where he related the particulars of them
to all of his acquaintance that he met. On the following
day, Mr. Tucker, of Trematon Castle, accompanied
by his wife, a daughter of Mr. Williams, went to Scorrier
House about dusk.</p>

<p>"Immediately after the first salutations on their
entering the parlour, where were Mr., Mrs., and Miss
Williams, Mr. Williams began to relate to Mr. Tucker
the circumstances of his dream; and Mrs. Williams
observed to her daughter, Mrs. Tucker, laughingly,
that her father could not even suffer Mr. Tucker to be
seated before he told him of his nocturnal visitation,
on the statement of which he observed that it would do
very well for a dream to have the (Lord) Chancellor in
the lobby of the House of Commons, but he could not
be found there in reality, and Mr. Tucker then asked
what sort of a man he appeared to be, when Mr.
Williams minutely described him, to which Mr. Tucker
replied: 'Your description is not that of the Lord
Chancellor, but it is certainly that of Mr. Perceval, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer; and although he has
been to me the greatest enemy I ever met in my life,
for a supposed cause which had no foundation or truth
(or words to that effect), I should be exceedingly sorry
indeed to hear of his being assassinated, or of injury
of the kind happening to him.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tucker then inquired of Mr. Williams if he
had ever seen Mr. Perceval, and was told that he had
never seen him, nor had ever even written to him
either on public or private business; in short, that
he never had anything to do with him, nor had he
ever been in the lobby of the House of Commons
in his life.</p>

<p>"Whilst Mr. Williams and Mr. Tucker were still
standing they heard a horse gallop to the door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the house, and immediately after Mr. Michael Williams,
of Trevince (son of Mr. Williams, of Scorrier) entered
the room, and said that he had galloped out of Truro
(from which Scorrier is distant seven miles), having
seen a gentleman there who had come by that evening's
mail from London, who said that he had been in the
lobby of the House of Commons on the evening of the
11th, when a man called Bellingham had shot Mr.
Perceval, and that, as it might occasion some great
ministerial changes, and might affect Mr. Tucker's
political friends, he had come as fast as he could to
make him acquainted with it, having heard at Truro
that he had passed through that place on his way to
Scorrier. After the astonishment which this intelligence
created had a little subsided, Mr. Williams
described most particularly the appearance and dress of
the man that he saw in his dream fire the pistol, as he
had before done of Mr. Perceval.</p>

<p>"About six weeks after, Mr. Williams, having
business in town, went, accompanied by a friend, to
the House of Commons, where, as has been already
observed, he had never before been. Immediately
that he came to the steps at the entrance to the lobby,
he said: 'This place is as distinctly within my recollection
in my dream as any in my house,' and he made the
same observation when he entered the lobby. He
there pointed out the exact spot where Bellingham
stood when he fired, and which Mr. Perceval had
reached when he was struck by the ball, and when and
how he fell. The dress, both of Mr. Perceval and
Bellingham, agreed with the description given by Mr.
Williams, even to the most minute particulars."</p>

<p>Such is this well-authenticated story. It is worth
notice that Mr. Williams saw the whole affair in dream
thrice repeated long after the real event had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
place, and not by any means at the moment of the
assassination. Some dreams that are well authenticated
may have led to the conviction of murderers. But this
did not; it was wholly useless; yet it is impossible to
deny that it really occurred.</p>

<h2>SIR ROBERT TRESILIAN</h2>


<p>Sir Robert Tresilian, of Tresilian, in
the parish of Newlyn, and by virtue of marriage
with the heiress of Haweis also lord of
Tremoderet in Duloe, was Lord Chief
Justice of England and adviser to King Richard II;
he accordingly drew upon himself the animosity of
the King's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of
Gloucester. But he had also drawn upon his head the
hatred of the commonalty by his "bloody circuit"
after the insurrection of Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, and
John Ball.</p>

<p>When Sir Robert Knollys had brought together a
large force against the insurgents, the young King had
forbidden him to slaughter them <i>en masse</i>, as he
proposed, "For," said he, "I will have their blood in
another way." And he had their blood by sending
Chief Justice Tresilian among them, and, according to
Holinshed, the number of executions amounted to
1500. At first they were beheaded; afterwards they
were hanged and left on the gibbet to excite terror; but
their friends cut down the bodies and carried them off;
whereupon the King ordered that they should be
hanged in strong iron chains; and this was the first
instance of this barbarous and disgusting practice in
England.</p>

<p>The King had promised the insurgent peasantry that
serfage should be abolished, that liberty should be
accorded to all to buy and sell in the markets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
that land should be let at fourpence an acre, that a
general amnesty should be accorded. To all these he
had acceded with charters signed and sealed; but so
soon as the disturbances were over he repudiated his
undertakings, and we cannot doubt that he did so at
the advice of Tresilian, who pronounced them illegal.</p>

<p>Richard did, indeed, in the next Parliament, urge the
abolition of villainage, but the proposal was coldly
received, not pressed, and rejected. Moreover, on the
occasion of his marriage with Anne of Bohemia, which
took place soon after, a general amnesty was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The people were, however, disaffected. The imposition
of a poll tax levied on rich and poor at the same
sum on all over fifteen, and the scandalous manner in
which it had been collected, had given general dissatisfaction,
and it was, in fact, this which had roused
Wat Tyler to march on London to obtain redress.</p>

<p>The King had surrounded himself with favourites,
and his uncles were excluded from his council.
The country was divided between the party of the
King and that of the Duke of Gloucester. There is
not the least reason to suppose that the latter had at
heart the welfare of the people of England, any more
than had the creatures who surrounded the King. The
Duke was moved by resentment, pride, and ambition,
and many believed that he aimed at the crown.</p>

<p>The chief favourites of Richard were Michael de la
Pole, whom he created Earl of Suffolk, and Robert de
Vere, a young and handsome man, who was made
Marquis of Dublin, receiving, at the same time, the
extraordinary grant of the whole revenue of Ireland,
out of which he was to pay a yearly rent of five thousand
marks to the King. He was soon after created
Duke of Ireland. The other advisers of the King were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
Worth, Archbishop of York, Sir Simon Burley, and Sir
Robert Tresilian. These certainly judged rightly when
they opposed the prosecution of the war in France,
and the subvention of the claims of the Duke of Lancaster
to the Crown of Castile. The country was being
drained of men and money in these profitless wars.
But the nobles, headed by Thomas of Gloucester,
opposed this policy, and naturally had the support of
those who made money out of the wars. To defeat the
plans of the council, Gloucester demanded the dismissal
of Suffolk. The King petulantly answered that
he would not at his command dismiss a scullion-boy
from his kitchen. Suffolk was, however, impeached
by the Commons for undue use of his influence, and
the King was obliged to submit to the fining and imprisonment
of his favourite. It was next proposed that
a council should be appointed to reform the State.
At this proposition Richard threatened to dissolve the
Parliament. A member of the Commons thereupon
moved that the statute deposing Edward II should be
read, and the King was warned that death might be
the penalty of a continued refusal. He yielded. The
commission was appointed, and Gloucester and his
friends, who formed the great majority, were masters
of England. In yielding, Richard limited the duration
of the commission to a year. The King was now
twenty years of age, but he was reduced to as mere a
cipher as when he was a boy of eleven.</p>

<p>In the month of August in the following year, 1387,
acting under the advice of Tresilian, he assembled a
council at Nottingham, and submitted to some of the
judges who attended it this question&mdash;Whether the
Commission of Government appointed by Parliament,
and approved of under his own seal, were legal or
illegal? Tresilian led the rest of the judges to certify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
that the commission was illegal, and that all those who
had introduced the measure were liable to capital
punishment; that all who supported it were by that
act guilty of high treason; in short, that both Lords
and Commons were traitors.</p>

<p>On the 11th November following the King returned
to London, when he was alarmed by hearing that the
Duke of Gloucester, the Earls of Arundel and Nottingham,
the Constable, Admiral, and Marshal of England
were approaching the capital at the head of forty thousand
men. The decision of Tresilian and the judges
and of the King had, in fact, forced them into rebellion,
as it was pretty evident that Richard aimed at
taking their lives.</p>

<p>So soon as Richard's cousin, the Earl of Derby,
heard of the approach of Gloucester, he quitted the
Court with the Earl of Warwick, went to Waltham
Cross, and there joined him. The members of the
Council of Eleven were there already. On Sunday, the
17th of November, the Duke entered London with an
irresistible force and "appealed" of treason the Archbishop
of York, De Vere, Duke of Ireland, De la Pole,
Earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of
England, and Sir Nicolas Brember, Knight, a London
grocer and Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p>The favourites instantly took to flight. De la Pole,
the condemned Chancellor, succeeded in reaching
France, where he died soon after; De Vere, Duke of
Ireland, got to the borders of Wales, where he raised
an army, acting in concert with the King; it was
resolved he should march to London. The Archbishop
of York escaped to Flanders, where he spent the rest
of his days as a village priest.</p>

<p>The fate of Chief Justice Tresilian must be told in
the words of Sir John Froissart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard had gone to Bristol to organize an army
against the Duke of Gloucester, and De Vere, the
Duke of Ireland, was with him there.</p>

<p>"While the army was collecting, the King and the
Duke in secret conference, determined to send one of
their confidential agents to London, to observe what
was going forward, and if the King's uncles still
remained there, to discover what they were doing.
After some consultation, they could think of no proper
person to send on this errand; when a knight who was
cousin to the Duke, called Sir Robert Tresilian,
stepped forth, and said to the Duke, 'I see the difficulty
you have to find a trusty person to send to London; I,
from love of you, will risk the adventure.' The King
and the Duke, well pleased with the offer, thanked him
for it. Tresilian left Bristol disguised as a poor tradesman,
mounted on a wretched hackney. He continued
his road to London, and lodged at an inn where he was
unknown; for no man could have ever imagined that
one of the King's counsellors and chamberlains would
have appeared in so miserable a dress.</p>

<p>"When in London, he picked up all the news that
was possible, for he could do no more, respecting the
King's uncles and the citizens. Having heard that
there was to be a meeting of the Dukes and their
council at Westminster, he determined to go thither to
learn secretly all he could of their proceedings. This
he executed, and fixed his quarters at an ale-house
right opposite the palace gate. He chose a chamber
the window of which looked into the palace yard, where
he posted himself to observe all who should come to
this Parliament. The greater part he knew, but was
not, from his disguise, known to them. He, however,
remained there at different times, so long, that a squire
of the Duke of Gloucester saw and recognized him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
for he had been many times in his company. Sir
Robert also at once recollected him, and withdrew
from the window; but the squire, having his suspicions,
said, 'Surely that must be Tresilian.' To be certain
on this point, he entered the ale-house, and said to the
landlady, 'Dame, tell me, on your troth, who is he
that is drinking in the room above; he is alone and
not in company.' 'On my troth, sir,' she replied, 'I
cannot give you his name; but he has been here some
time.' At these words, the squire went upstairs to
know the truth, and having saluted Sir Robert, found
he was right, though he dissembled by saying, 'God
preserve you, master! I hope you will not take my
coming amiss, for I thought you had been one of my
farmers from Essex, as you are so very like him.' 'By
no means,' said Sir Robert; 'I am from Kent, and hold
lands of Sir John Holland, and wish to lay my complaints
before the Council against the tenants of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who encroach much on my
farm.' 'If you will come into the hall,' said the squire,
'I will have way made for you to lay your grievances
before the lords.' 'Many thanks,' replied Sir Robert;
'not at this moment, but I shall not renounce your
assistance.' At the words the squire ordered a quart
of ale, and having paid for it, he said, 'God be with
you!' and left the ale-house.</p>

<p>"He lost no time in hastening to the council-chamber,
and called to the usher to open the door.
The usher, knowing him, asked his business. He said,
'he must instantly speak with the Duke of Gloucester,
on matters that mainly concerned him and the council.'
The usher, on this, bade him enter, which he did, and
made up to the Duke of Gloucester, saying, 'My lord,
I will tell it aloud; for it concerns not you only but all
the lords present. I have seen Sir Robert Tresilian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
disguised as a peasant, in an ale-house close by the
palace gate.' 'Tresilian!' exclaimed the Duke. 'On
my faith, my lord, it is true; and you will have him to
dine with, if you please.' 'I should like it much,'
replied the Duke; 'for he will tell us some news of his
master, the Duke of Ireland. Go, and secure him; but
with power enough not to be in danger of failing.'</p>

<p>"The squire on these orders, left the council-chamber,
and having chosen four bailiffs, said to them,
'Follow me at a distance; and so soon as you shall
perceive me make you a sign to arrest a man I am in
search of, lay hands on him, and take care he do not,
on any account, escape.' The squire made for the ale-house
where he had left Sir Robert, and, mounting the
staircase to the room where he was, said, on entering:
'Tresilian, you are not come to this country for any
good, as I imagine; my Lord of Gloucester sends me
for you, and you must come and speak with him.' The
knight turned a deaf ear, and would have been excused
by saying, 'I am not Tresilian, but a tenant of Sir
John Holland.'</p>

<p>"'That is not true,' replied the squire; 'your body
is Tresilian's, though not your dress.' And, making a
sign to the bailiffs, who were at the door, they entered
the house and arrested him, and, whether he would or
not, carried him to the palace. You may believe, there
was a great crowd to see him; for he was well known
in London, and in many parts of England.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Gloucester was much pleased, and
would see him. When in his presence, the Duke
said: 'Tresilian, what has brought you hither? How
fares my Sovereign? Where does he now reside?'
Tresilian, finding that he was discovered, and that no
excuses would avail, replied: 'On my faith, my lord,
the King has sent me hither to learn the news. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
in Bristol, and on the banks of the Severn, where he
hunts and amuses himself.'</p>

<p>"'How!' said the Duke, 'You do not come dressed
as an honest man, but like a spy. If you had been
desirous to learn what was passing, your appearance
should have been like that of a knight or a decent
person.' 'My lord,' answered Tresilian, 'if I have
done wrong, I hope you will excuse me, for I have
only done what I was bid.' 'And where is your
master, the Duke of Ireland?' 'My lord,' said Tresilian,
'he is with the King, my lord.' The Duke
then added: 'We have been informed that he is collecting
a large body of men, and that the King has
issued his summons to that effect. Whither does he
mean to lead them?' 'My lord, they are indeed for
Ireland.' 'For Ireland!' said the Duke. 'Yes, indeed,
as God may help me,' answered Tresilian.</p>

<p>"The Duke mused awhile, and then spoke: 'Tresilian,
Tresilian, your actions are neither fair nor honest.
You have committed a great piece of folly in coming
to these parts, where you are far from being loved, as
will shortly be shown to you. Yes, and others of your
faction have done what has greatly displeased my
brother and myself, and have ill-advised the King,
whom you have stirred up to quarrel with his chief
nobility. In addition, you have excited the principal
towns against us. The day of retribution is therefore
come, when you shall receive payment; for whoever
acts unjustly receives his reward. Look to your affairs,
for I will neither eat nor drink till you be no more.'</p>

<p>"This speech greatly terrified Sir Robert (for no one
likes to hear of his end) by the manner in which it was
uttered. He was desirous to obtain pardon, by various
excuses, and the most abject humiliation, but in vain.
The Duke had received information of what was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
on at Bristol, and his excuses were frivolous. Why
should I make a long story? Sir Robert was delivered
to the hangman, who led him out to the place of
execution, where he was beheaded, and then hung by
the arms to a gibbet. Thus ended Sir Robert Tresilian."</p>

<h2>PIRATE TRELAWNY</h2>


<p>Edward John Trelawny, a younger
son of Charles Brereton Trelawny, came into
this world on the 2nd or 3rd of November,
but in what year is not certain. It is said that
he was born in 1792, but either this is a wrong date, or
else Colonel Vivian, in his <i>Visitations of Cornwall</i>,
errs, for he gives that year as the one in which Harry
Brereton Trelawny, the eldest son, was born. Charles
Brereton Trelawny was the son of Harry Trelawny, a
lieutenant-general in the army and Governor of Landguard
Fort.</p>

<p>Of his father, Edward John entertained no favourable
opinion. "My father, notwithstanding his increased
fortune, did not increase his expenditure; nay, he
established, if possible, a stricter system of economy.
The only symptom he ever showed of imagination was
castle-building; but his fabrications were founded on a
more solid basis than is usually to be met with among
the visions of day-dreamers. No unreal mockery of
fairy scenes of bliss found a resting-place in his bosom.
Ingots, money, lands, houses, and tenements constituted
his dreams. He became a mighty arithmetician
by the aid of a ready reckoner, his pocket companion; he
set down to a fraction the sterling value of all his and his
wife's relations, the heirs at law, their nearest of kin,
their ages, and the state of their constitutions. The
insurance table was examined to calculate the value of
their lives; to this he added the probable chances arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
from diseases, hereditary and acquired, always forgetting
his own gout. He then determined to regulate
his conduct accordingly; to maintain the most friendly
intercourse with his wealthy connexions, and to keep
aloof from the poor ones. Having no occasion to
borrow, his aversion to lending amounted to antipathy.
The distrust and horror he expressed at the slightest
allusion to loans, unbacked by security and interest,
had the effect of making the most imprudent and adventurous
desist from essaying him, and continue in their
necessities, or beg, or rob, or starve, in preference to
urging their wants to him.</p>

<p>"It was his custom to appropriate a room in the
house to the conservation of those things he loved&mdash;choice
wines, foreign preserves, cordials. This sanctum
was a room on the ground floor, under a skylight.
Our next-door neighbours' pastime happened to be a
game of balls, when one of them lodged on the leaded
roof of this consecrated room. Two of my sisters, of
the ages of fourteen and sixteen, ran from the drawing-room
back window to seek for the ball, and slipping on
the leads, the younger fell through the skylight on to
the bottles and jars upon the table below. She was
dreadfully bruised, and her hands, legs and face were
cut, so much so, that she still retains the scars. Her
sister gave the alarm. My mother was called; she
went to the door of the store-room; her child screamed
out, for God's sake to open the door; she was bleeding
to death. My mother dared not break the lock, as my
father had prohibited any one from entering this, his
blue chamber; and what was worse, he had the key.
Other keys were tried, but none could open the door.
Had I been there, my foot should have picked the lock.
Will it be believed that, in that state, my sister was
compelled to await my father's return from the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
of Commons, of which he was a member? At last,
when he returned, my mother informed him of the
accident, and tried to allay the wrath which she saw
gathering on his brow. He took no notice of her, but
paced forward to the closet, when the delinquent, awed
by his dreadful voice, hushed her sobs. He opened
the door and found her there, scarcely able to stand,
trembling and weeping. Without speaking a word,
he kicked and cuffed her out of the room, and then
gloomily decanted what wine remained in the broken
bottles."</p>

   <p class="caption2">EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY<br />
<i>From a drawing by D. Lucas</i></p>
</div>

<p>The mother of Edward John was Maria, sister of Sir
Christopher Hawkins, of Trewithen.</p>

<p>That a high-spirited, self-willed, passionate boy like
Edward John should get on with such a father was
antecedently improbable; and he was sent to sea at the
age of twelve in the <i>Superb</i>, and had the ill fortune to
miss the battle of Trafalgar, through Admiral Duckworth
delaying three days at Plymouth to victual his
ships with mutton and potatoes.</p>

<p>"Young as I was, I shall never forget our falling in
with the <i>Pickle</i> schooner off Trafalgar, carrying the
first despatches of the battle and death of its hero.
Her commander, burning with impatience to be the
first to convey the news to England, was compelled to
heave to and come on board us. Captain Keates
received him on deck, and when he heard the news
I was by his side. Silence reigned throughout the
ship; some great event was anticipated. The officers
stood in groups, watching with intense anxiety the two
commanders, who walked apart. 'Battle,' 'Nelson,'
'ships,' were the only audible words which could be
gathered from their conversation. I saw the blood rush
into Keates's face; he stamped the deck, walked hurriedly,
and spoke with passion. I marvelled, for I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
never before seen him much moved; he had appeared
cool, firm, and collected on all occasions, and it struck
me that some awful event had taken place, or was at
hand. The Admiral was still in his cabin, eager for
news from the Nelson fleet. He was an irritable and
violent man, and after a few minutes, swelling with
wrath, he sent an order to Keates, who possibly heard it
not, but staggered along the deck, struck to the heart
by the news, and, for the first time in his life, forgot
his respect to his superior in rank; muttering, as it
seemed, curses on his fate that, by the Admiral's delay,
he had not participated in the most glorious battle in
naval history. Another messenger enforced him to
descend in haste to the Admiral, who was high in rage
and impatience.</p>

<p>"Keates, for I followed him, on entering the Admiral's
cabin said in a subdued voice, as if he were choking,
'A great battle has been fought, two days ago, off
Trafalgar. The combined fleets of France and Spain
are annihilated, and Nelson is no more!' He then
murmured, 'Had we not been detained we should
have been there.'</p>

<p>"Duckworth answered not, conscience-struck, but
stalked the deck. He seemed ever to avoid the look
of his captain, and turned to converse with the commander
of the schooner, who replied in sulky brevity,
'Yes' or 'No.' Then, dismissing him, he ordered all
sail to be set, and walked the quarter-deck alone. A
death-like stillness pervaded the ship, broken at intervals
by the low murmurs of the crew and officers,
when 'battle' and 'Nelson' could alone be distinguished.
Sorrow and discontent were painted on
every face.</p>

<p>"On the following morning we fell in with a portion
of the victorious fleet. It was blowing a gale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
they lay wrecks on the sea. Our Admiral communicated
with them, and then, joining Collingwood, had
six sail of the line put under his command, with orders
to pursue that part of the enemy's fleet which had
escaped; and I joined the ship to which I was appointed.
It is unnecessary to dwell on the miseries of a cockpit
life: I found it more tolerable than my school, and
little worse than my home."</p>

<p>When paid off he was sent under a Scotch captain,
who treated him badly, and then he was in another
vessel and resolved to desert the service. This he did
at Bombay. So far we can trust what Trelawny has
given us in that remarkable book <i>Adventures of a
Younger Son</i>; but from this point on he romances, but
romances with an air of reality. It is not possible to
discriminate fact from fiction in what follows. Undoubtedly
Pirate Trelawny started on his memoirs with
the intent of writing his autobiography, but he was
inordinately vain, and delighted in posturing as a hero
and in describing marvellous adventures through which
he passed, heightening them sensationally with wonderful
skill.</p>

<p>What seems probable is that, after deserting from the
navy, he was for a while in the merchant service, and
then joined a privateer cruising in the India seas. As
Mr. E. Garnett well says, "the Younger Son is an
excellent stage hero by the finish; he meets and overcomes
all odds; it is truly a glorious Trelawny&mdash;the
Trelawny of his own imagination."</p>

<p>He states that he was married when he was twenty-one,
and that the marriage took place in England, so
that he must have returned home somewhere about
1813. But we really know nothing authentic of his
movements till 1822, when he was in England, and
thence went to Italy, where he made acquaintance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Lord Byron and with Shelley. After the lamentable
death of the latter poet he attended at the cremation of
the body. Thence he went with Byron to Greece in
the <i>Hercules</i>, to aid the Greeks against the Turks.
They arrived at Cephalonia, off the west coast, in the
beginning of August, 1823, and there Lord Byron
resolved on staying till he could ascertain how things
were progressing in Greece and decide on his future
course of action. This delay did not at all suit the
impetuosity of the character of Trelawny, who called it
dawdling, and set forward for the mainland in company
with Hamilton Browne, making his way to the seat
of the Greek Government. He also sent emissaries to
England to endeavour to raise a loan, and then proceeded
to Athens. Here the insurgent leader Odysseus
was in command, and to his fortunes Trelawny at once
attached himself, and married the sister of the Greek
chieftain.</p>

<p>Major Temple, resident at Santa Maura, during his
mission to the Morea in June, 1824, met Odysseus,
and described him as "a perfect Albanian chieftain&mdash;savage
in manners and appearance, of great muscular
strength, and about six feet high."</p>

<p>He had his head-quarters in a huge cavern in the
face of the limestone precipices of Mount Parnassus,
which he had strongly fortified, and in this he kept his
treasure that he had accumulated and lodged his family.
In the meantime dissension had broken out among the
Greeks, between the leaders of the bands that did all
the fighting, under Kolokotroni, and the Executive
Government that had been elected by the primates,
at the head of which stood Mavrocordato. A complete
rupture had ensued at the end of 1823 between the
parties, and the guerilla chieftains absolutely refused
obedience to the Provisional Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same winter of 1823-4 Trelawny accompanied
Odysseus as <i>aide-de-camp</i> upon an expedition into
Negropont, and on their return to Athens, where
Colonel Stanhope then was, Trelawny sent a letter to
his mother, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">

"<span class="smcap">Athens</span>, <i>18th February, 1824.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I am enabled to keep twenty-five
followers, Albanian soldiers, with whom I have joined
the most enterprising of the Greek captains and most
powerful&mdash;Ulysses. I am much with him, and have
done my best during the winter campaign, in which we
have besieged Negropont, to make up for the many years
of idleness I have led. I am now in my element, and the
energy of my youth is reawakened. I have clothed
myself in the Albanian costume and sworn to uphold
the cause.</p>

<p>"Everything here is going on as well as heart can
wish. Great part of Greece is already emancipated.
The Morea is free, and we are making rapid progress
to the westward. Lord Byron spends £5000 a year in
the cause and maintains five hundred soldiers. This
will in the eyes of the world redeem the follies of youth.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">"Your affectionate son,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">"<span class="smcap">Edward Trelawny</span>."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Trelawny and Odysseus desired to get Lord Byron
to be with them, but this plan was frustrated by the
death of the poet on April 19th, 1824.</p>

<p>Colonel Stanhope proposed a congress of the civil
and military leaders, so as to effect a reconciliation between
the two embittered elements that were weakening
the resistance against the common enemy, the
Turk. Odysseus consented to attend this meeting at
Salona, and Trelawny also agreed to be present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Mavrocordato looked on Trelawny with suspicion as
intimate with Odysseus and as his brother-in-law, and
he foisted upon him an English spy named Fenton, and
an accomplice of the name of Whitcombe, with secret
instructions to make away with him.</p>

<p>After returning from Salona, Trelawny was with
Odysseus in Eastern Greece, carrying on the war in
guerilla fashion without any great results.</p>

<p>In the autumn he was at Argos, whence a letter
(certainly his, though unsigned) was sent to his brother
Lieutenant Harry Trelawny, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span></p>

<p>"... To give you an idea of the misery existing
here is beyond all expression. The town is nothing
more or less than a chaos of ruins; not a house inhabitable.
The fever making great havoc, people
actually falling down in the streets. The stench of the
place is so great I am obliged to remove my quarters
to the once famous Argos, not more than an hour's
walk from Agamemnon's tomb, which I have not yet
seen. The scenery is beautiful; perfectly romantic. I
am now living in a house without doors or windows,
every man armed.</p>

<p>"The Commissioners are both sick. Mr. Bulwer has
proposed to raise a body of fifty men, but I am afraid it
will all evaporate in smoke, like all his undertakings
here. I am much afraid nothing is to be done: they
look on all foreigners as intruders. Many of the
French have behaved most shamefully, but, as I told
you before, I will exert every effort. All my hopes are
placed in Colonel Gordon's arrival.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Your Brother.</span>"
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Commissioners referred to were Henry Lytton
Bulwer (Lord Dalling) and J. H. Browne, sent out by
the Greek Committee in London, when it was too late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
to ascertain whether the Greek Provisional Government
was sufficiently firmly established, and sufficiently trustworthy,
to warrant the paying over to it of that part of
the loan raised in England on their behalf not already
advanced. The loan was of £800,000, but from this
56.4 per cent was deducted, so that the whole amount
to be forwarded to the Greek Government would be
only £348,000.</p>

<p>Odysseus was beset with difficulties, as the Provisional
Government refused to furnish him with men or money.
Trelawny made vain attempts to raise funds.</p>

<p>Ultimately Odysseus made a truce for three months
with Omer Pasha, of Negropont, but being regarded
with suspicion on both sides, he endeavoured to make
his escape, and left Trelawny in charge of the cave and
its contents. It was at this time that Fenton, the hired
spy, in May, 1825, made the attempt to assassinate Trelawny.
He took the opportunity when Trelawny's
back was towards him to shoot him.</p>

<p>Odysseus was compelled to surrender to the Government,
was carried off to Athens, where he was strangled
by order of Mavrocordato.</p>

<p>Trelawny's wounds were so dangerous that he
suffered for three months before he could be said to
have recovered, and he then escaped from the cavern
and landed in Cephalonia in September, 1825, bringing
his Albanian wife with him. During the next two
years he was engaged in a lawsuit about his wife, whom
he treated with brutality, so that she left him and
retired to a convent, with purpose ultimately to proceed
to Paxo, where lived her sister. Whilst in the
convent she was delivered of a child which she sent to
Trelawny to be put out to nurse, as they objected in
the convent to have the infant there. Trelawny sent
it to a woman who undertook to rear it, but it died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
whereupon, as Mr. H. Robinson of Zante wrote to
Toole on 22nd November, 1827, "he sent the dead
body to the Castle Monastery, where she (his wife) was,
in a box with her things and a message from him.
The wife knew not what was in the box and refused to
open it, and there it lay until putrid.</p>

<p>"An examination took place with all the fuss which
the courts make about <i>suspicione d'infanticido</i>, and
ended by T. being fined two dollars for improperly
removing a dead body."</p>

<p>In or about the month of July, 1829, Signora
Trelawny made petition to the Lord High Commissioner
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is perhaps known to Your Excellency that at
about the age of thirteen I was given in marriage to
Signor Trelawny, my family urging that I should live
happily with one brought up in the courtesy and good-breeding
of his country; but, as my experience proved,
he failed to treat me with that consideration and
nobility of character which distinguish the men of
his nation. The nature of the long-continued treatment
which I have had to endure at the hands of the
said Signor Trelawny is not unknown, and at the last,
it is perhaps within Your Excellency's recollection that
he brought grief to my very eyes by sending me
while in the convent, with cunning and brutality, the
dead body of my daughter and his."</p>

<p>She then stated that Zante had become lonely for
her, as her brothers and mother had gone to Greece.
She wanted to go to Paxo to her sister, but the custom
of Zante obliged a wife separated from her husband to
live in a convent.</p>

<p>She continued: "I venture humbly to ask Your
Excellency if, being the wife of an Englishman, I
ought to be subject to the custom of the island in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
which I chance to find myself a resident. Should an
Englishwoman be subjected to such treatment as I
am?... I promise Your Excellency that, in whatever
place or situation I find myself, I will conduct
myself always as is proper for the wife of an English
gentleman; and though he himself may be wanting in
dignity of behaviour, I will do neither him nor myself
the dishonour of imitating him.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Tersitza Philippa Trelawny.</span>"
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This petition and the letter of Mr. Robinson suffice
to show that the story of Trelawny sending his dead
child in a box to its mother is not to be rejected as
a fable, as it has been by the author of the notice on
Edward John Trelawny in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The poor unfortunate girl, then aged
seventeen, obtained a separation from her husband
<i>a mensa et thoro</i>, by a sentence of the Ecclesiastical
Court, and by definitive sentences of the courts of
law in Zante and Corfu she was entitled to an aliment
from her husband of twenty-five dollars a month, for
the payment of which Mr. Barff, the banker of Zante,
and Mr. Stevens, of Corfu, were securities. But this
was the result of much litigation, causing Trelawny
annoyance and angering him to the last degree.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1828 he visited England, but returned
to the Continent in the spring of the following
year, feeling out of his element at home. "To whom
am I a neighbour?" he wrote, "and near whom? I
dwell amongst tame and civilized human beings with
somewhat the same feelings as we may guess the lion
feels when, torn from his native wildness, he is tortured
into domestic intercourse with what Shakespeare calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
'forked animals,' the most abhorrent to his nature."
He rambled about; set up a harem in Athens, bought a
Moorish girl to be his concubine, wrote his <i>Adventures
of a Younger Son</i>, and sent the MS. in 1830 to Mrs.
Shelley, and it was published in three volumes in 1831,
with some excisions of grossness and licentiousness,
which the publisher insisted on having removed. As
already said, no reliance can be placed on this autobiography
as a narrative of the facts of his life, except
only of his boyhood, for, as Lord Byron said of Trelawny,
"he could not speak the truth even if he
wished to do so."</p>

<p>When the book appeared, the <i>Athenæum</i> considered
the hero&mdash;Trelawny himself&mdash;"a kind of ruffian from
his birth," as he had painted himself, leaving out the
villainies and brutalities of which he had been guilty.</p>

<p>He was thrice married, and behaved badly to all
three wives. He could not be faithful and generous
even to his friends. With Byron he had been most
intimate, yet when Byron died he wrote to Mary
Shelley: "It is well for his name, and better for
Greece, that Byron is dead.... I now feel my face
burn with shame that so weak and ignoble a soul could
so long have influenced me. It is a degrading reflection,
and ever will be. I wish he had lived a little
longer, that he might have witnessed how I would
have soared above him here, how I would have
triumphed over his mean spirit." Trelawny soaring!&mdash;as
a vulture only in quest of carrion.</p>

<p>And when, in 1858, he published his <i>Recollections of
Shelley and Byron</i>, thirty-four years after the death of
the latter, he painted Byron in the harshest colours;
and one can hardly escape feeling that this was
prompted by jealousy of the esteem in which the
world held Byron for his genius. He himself possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
all the bad qualities that he despised in Byron,
but did not recognize in himself the superadded
brutality which Byron was too much a gentleman to
show.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Shelley, a lifelong friend and correspondent,
to whom he had often poured out his heart,
and whom he had contemplated at one time marrying,
could not be spoken of by him after her death but
in disparagement and with a revelation to the world of
her little weaknesses.</p>

<p>He was in England again in 1835, went into society,
and married for the third time, to make another woman
miserable. For a number of years he lived at Putney
Hill, and then took a farm at Usk, in Monmouthshire,
and amused himself with farming.</p>

<p>In or about 1870, Trelawny, then seventy-eight
years old, bought a house and a small plot of land
at Sompting, near Wortham, and occupied himself
with gardening. One day two men with guns in their
hands requested permission to enter his grounds after
a bird that had taken refuge there. He answered
fiercely, "All the leave I will accord you is to shoot
one another."</p>

<p>At Sompting, Trelawny died on August 13th, 1881,
at the age of eighty-six. In accordance with his wish
to be laid beside Shelley, his body was embalmed in
England, cremated at Gotha, and the ashes taken to
the Protestant burial-ground in Rome, and laid in the
tomb he had bought fifty-eight years before, next to
those of his friend.</p>

<p>Trelawny was a very handsome man, tall and well
built; he had flashing dark eyes under beetling brows,
and an aquiline nose, raven-black hair, and a dusky,
Spanish complexion. He spoke very loud. He retained
his good looks to the end of his days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>Shelley described him in <i>Fragments of an Unfinished
Drama</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was as is the sun in his fierce youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As terrible and lovely as a tempest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Millais' painting of "The North-West Passage,"
exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1874, the old sailor
is a portrait of Captain Trelawny; and it has been conjectured
that Thackeray delineated him as Captain
Sumph in <i>Pendennis</i>, I, cap. 35.</p>

<p>The authorities for Trelawny's life are, beside the
first part of his <i>Adventures of a Younger Son</i>, his
<i>Recollections of Shelley and Byron</i>, 1858; the new edition
of the work, published in 1878, was called <i>Records of
Shelley, Byron, and the Author</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Garnett has a notice of the life of Trelawny
prefixed to the edition of the <i>Adventures of a Younger
Son</i> of 1890. A lengthy life of Trelawny is in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. An error in this
is pointed out by Mr. T. C. Down in the article on
"Pirate Trelawny" already referred to and quoted
from.</p>

<p>A pleasant account of "Mr. Trelawny and his
Friends" appeared in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for
1878.</p>

<p>Something further about him may be gleaned from
Frances A. Kemble's <i>Records of a Girlhood</i>, 1878,
III, 75, 308-12. There are corrections of some of
Trelawny's inaccuracies in D. Guido Biagi's <i>The Last
Days of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i>, 1898.</p>

<h2>JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM</h2>


<p>Mr. S. C. Hall, writing after the death
of J. S. Buckingham, thus expressed his
opinion of this truly remarkable man:
"Whatever, during his life, envy,
jealousy, monopolous interest or satirical hostility
may have said to the contrary, there can be little
doubt, now he is gone, that the late Mr. James Silk
Buckingham was amongst the most useful as well as
the most hopeful and industrious men of his time.
His career was one remarkable illustration of the well-known
line of the old song, 'It's wonderful what we
can do if we try'; for at almost every step he took he
was met by some disaster or annoyance, yet kept
pressing on with the most dauntless persistence,
making the best of the worst circumstances, and even
when failing in his own personal endeavours, giving
such an impulse to the powers of others in whatever
cause or course he had engaged, that the end in view
was generally attained, and in several notable instances
within the period of his own life."</p>

<p>The Buckinghams were a North Devon family, and
the grandfather of the subject of this notice had lived
in Barnstaple. For several generations they had been
connected with the sea. Christopher Buckingham
settled at Flushing on a small farm, along with his
wife Thomazine, daughter of a Hambley of Bodmin.</p>

<p>James Silk describes his father as wearing a cocked
hat, long, square-tailed coat with large pockets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
sleeves, square-toed shoes with silver buckles, and as
walking abroad carrying a tall, gold-headed cane.</p>

<p>James Silk was born at Flushing on the 25th August,
1786. He had two brothers and a sister. His father
died in 1794.</p>

<p>"The port of Falmouth," wrote he in his unfinished
memoirs, "being nearest to the entrance of the
Channel, there were permanently stationed here two
squadrons of frigates, one under the command of Sir
Edward Pellew (afterwards Lord Exmouth), the other
under the command of Sir John Borlase Warren. The
former, as commodore, hoisted his pennant on the
<i>Indefatigable</i>, the latter on the <i>Révolutionaire</i>. Each
squadron consisted of five frigates of thirty-two and
forty-four guns each; and, in addition to these, there
were continually arriving and departing from Carrick
Roads, the outer anchorage of Falmouth, line-of-battle
ships and smaller vessels of war; while the prizes
taken from the French were constantly brought into
the port for adjudication and sale. There were two
large prisons, with open courts, for the reception of
the French prisoners thus taken, and every month
added many to their inmates.</p>

<p>"Both the naval commodores, as well as such captains
of the frigates belonging to the squadrons as were
married, had their families residing at Flushing, and
the numerous officers of different grades, from the
youngest midshipman to the first lieutenant, were continually
coming and going to and fro ... so that the
little village literally sparkled with gold epaulets and
gold-laced hats and brilliant uniforms."</p>

<p>He tells a curious story of his childhood. Corn,
owing to the war, had mounted to famine price, and
the miners of Cornwall went about in gangs waging
war against all forestallers, regraters, and hoarders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
grain, and demolishing bakers' shops, mills, and grain
stores.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_558.png" id="i_558.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_558.png" alt="JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM" title="JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM" />
   <p class="caption2">JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM</p>
</div>

<p>"A body of some three or four hundred of these men
entered Flushing, and as they were all dressed in the
mud-stained smock frocks and trousers in which they
worked underground, all armed with large clubs and
sticks of various kinds, and speaking an uncouth
jargon, which none but themselves could understand,
they struck terror wherever they went. Their numbers
were quite equal to the whole adult male population of
the little village, so that the men stood aghast, the
women retired into their houses, and closed their doors,
and the children seemed struck dumb with affright.
The moment of their visit, too, was most inopportune,
for on that very day a large party of the captains and
officers of the packets residing at Flushing were occupied
in storing a cargo of grain that had just been
discharged from a coasting vessel at the quay, and
locking it up in warehouses to secure it from plunder."</p>

<p>At this time it happened that all the ships of war
were absent on their cruising grounds. The situation
was dangerous, and the men threatened an attack on
the warehouses, and were muttering and brandishing
their clubs, and falling into ranks, when Captain
Kempthorne snatched up little James Silk, then an
urchin of six or seven, seated him on a sack of corn,
and bade him strike up a hymn.</p>

<p>With his shrill little pipe, he started&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Salvation, O! the joyful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis music to our ears.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon at once the mob took up the chant, sang
the hymn, with their strong masculine lungs; the clubs
were let fall, and, the hymn ended, they dispersed
harmlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>James Silk went to sea in the <i>Lady Harriet</i>, a Government
packet. On his third voyage to Lisbon he was
captured by a French corvette and assigned to prison
at Corunna; he was then about ten years old, and the
gaoler's daughter of the same age fell in love with him,
and softened the rigour of his captivity by bringing
him dainties from her father's table. She tried to
induce the boy to elope with her, but James had sufficient
English common sense not to accept the offer, and
finally he was sent to Lisbon, obliged to tramp the
whole way, several hundred miles, barefooted, and
begging food and a lodging on his way. At Lisbon he
was taken on board the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, and returned
to England, where his mother induced him to leave the
sea, and provided him with a small stationer's and
bookseller's shop on the Fish Strand, Falmouth. His
mother died in 1804, and when James Silk was aged
only nineteen he married Elizabeth Jennings, a farmer's
daughter. He got tired of being a shopkeeper and
volunteered on board a man-of-war; but on seeing a
seaman flogged round the fleet for mutiny, was so disgusted
with the sight that he deserted, and started a bookshop
at Plymouth Dock. However one of the trustees
of his wife's inheritance had speculated with the money
in smuggling ventures and lost all, so that J. S. Buckingham
became bankrupt. He went to sea again, and
was appointed chief officer on board the <i>Titus</i>, bound
for Trinidad, Captain Jennings, perhaps a kinsman of
his wife.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-two he became commander of
a vessel, and made several voyages to the West Indies
and in the Mediterranean. In these latter he rapidly
acquired a knowledge of and even fluency in speech in
French, Italian, Greek, and Arabic, and this determined
him to undertake mercantile life at Malta; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
plague having broken out there in 1818, he was prevented
from landing, and resolved to try his fortune at
Smyrna, but was unsuccessful. He then went to
Alexandria, and thence to Cairo, where he made the
acquaintance and gained the esteem of Mahomet Ali,
then Pasha of Egypt.</p>

<p>He now formed the scheme of connecting the Red
Sea with the Mediterranean by a canal, and for this
purpose surveyed the Isthmus of Suez and convinced
himself that the cutting of such a waterway was quite
feasible, and that such a connection would be of enormous
advantage to English trade with India. He laid
his plans before Mahomet Ali. "No sooner had the
idea of renewing the ancient commerce between India
and the Mediterranean by way of the Red Sea taken
possession of my mind," wrote Buckingham, "than
I began to think how much this would be facilitated by
the juncture of the two seas by a navigable canal; and
I bent all my thoughts to the object." But Mahomet
Ali would not hear of the project. He shrewdly asked,
"Whose ships would mostly use the canal?"</p>

<p>"The English vessels assuredly."</p>

<p>"Ah! and then the English would begin to think
how nice it would be to have Egypt so as to secure the
passage. I am not going to sharpen the knife that
would cut my own throat."</p>

<p>The Pasha had a plan of his own; he had purchased
two beautiful American brigs then in the harbour of
Alexandria, and he proposed arming them and sending
them round the Cape of Good Hope into the Red Sea,
for he desired to open up a trade with Egypt from India.
But Buckingham pointed out to him that he could not
do this without great risk of losing them, as the East
India Company had supreme command of all the
Indian Ocean eastward of the Cape, and would seize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
and confiscate all vessels found in those seas without
their licence, French and Portuguese vessels alone
excepted.</p>

<p>James S. Buckingham now ascended the Nile beyond
the cataracts to Nubia, but was there seized with ophthalmic
blindness. To add to his distress, on his way to
Kosseir he was attacked in the desert by a band of
mutineers of the army of the Pasha, who plundered
and left him entirely naked on the barren waste, many
miles from any village, food, or water; and even when
he reached Kosseir, he was obliged to retrace his steps,
as the vessel which should have conveyed him forward
had been seized by the mutineers.</p>

<p>Buckingham next occupied himself with an endeavour
to master the hydrography of the Red Sea, visiting
every part in the costume of a Bedouin Arab.</p>

<p>The Pasha now proposed to him that he should go
to India and sound the merchants there as to establishing
a through trade to Europe by the Red Sea, and a
Company of Anglo-Egyptian merchants took the matter
up with zest. But on his proceeding to Bombay he
found that the proposition was coldly received.</p>

<p>Whilst there, in May, 1815, Buckingham had the offer
of the command of the <i>Humayoon Shah</i>, a vessel built
at the Portuguese port of Damann, north of Bombay, by
the Imaum of Muscat, for trade with China. The retiring
captain, named Richardson, in three successive
voyages had cleared £30,000, and the situation had
been sought by several of the marine officers of the East
India Company. When these disappointed men heard
that Buckingham had secured the appointment, they
were angry, and applied to the Company to eject him
from India and close every port there in their power
against him. This they did by refusing him a licence
to remain in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>The British Government, in granting a charter of
exclusive trade to India and China to the East India
Company, gave that Company thereby a right to
expel from their dominions all British-born subjects
who had not their licence to reside there, this being
deemed necessary to protect them from the competition
of "interlopers" as they were called, who might undersell
them in their own markets. But though the
British Government might thus condemn all the twenty
million of its own native-born subjects to this state of
ignominious dependence on the will or caprice of a
handful of monopolists, a body of some twenty-four
directors only&mdash;in whose hands lay the power of granting
licences or banishing those who did not possess
them&mdash;it could not authorize the exercise of such powers
against the natives of any foreign state; consequently
James Silk Buckingham was advised to become
nationalized as an American citizen, in which case the
East India Company would be powerless to expel
him.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the case stood thus: all foreigners
who had no natural claim on India as a part of
their dominions might visit it freely and reside and
trade in it as long as they pleased, without licence
from its rulers; whereas British-born subjects, who had
contributed by their payment of taxes to support the
very Government that made the charter, were unjustly
excluded, although the conquest of India had been
made by British blood and British treasure, and the
country was still held under the British flag. In
short, all foreigners were free men there, and the freeborn
Englishman alone was a slave.</p>

<p>Buckingham so felt the iniquity of this system that
later, when he came to England, he agitated and wrote
against the continuance of the charter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>Buckingham returned to Egypt and occupied himself
with making a chart of the Red Sea. But the Anglo-Egyptian
merchants, not relishing their defeat by the
East India Company, entered into a compact with
Mahomet Ali to send Buckingham to India as his
envoy and representative; and as such the Company
could not refuse to allow him to reside there. Accordingly,
habited as a Mussulman, turbaned and long-robed,
with his speaking eye, jovial face, and dark, flowing
beard, he looked every inch of him a true-born Oriental,
and his extraordinary knowledge of various languages
stood him in good stead as he made his way overland
to India, by Palestine and Bagdad. Proceeding still
on his course, he entered Persia, crossed the chain of
the Zagros, and embarked at Bushir in a man-of-war of
the East India Company that was bound on an expedition
against some Wahabee pirates in the Persian
Gulf, and going ashore at Ras el Khyma, acted as interpreter
to Captain Brydges, Commander of the Squadron,
assisted in bombarding the town, and then proceeded
to Bombay, which he reached after a journey of twelve
months. But his mission was again unsuccessful;
either the Bombay merchants had no confidence in the
Egyptian Government, or they were jealous of any
interference with their own line of trade.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Company's licence reached him,
authorizing him to remain in their territories, and he
regained the appointment to the vessel <i>Humayoon
Shah</i>, in the service of the Imaum of Muscat, and he
remained navigating the Eastern waters till Midsummer,
1818, when, having received commands from the Imaum
to proceed to the coast of Zanzibar, on a slaving expedition,
he threw up his engagement, worth £4000
per annum, rather than be implicated in such a nefarious
trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>Buckingham next became proprietor and editor of
the <i>Calcutta Mirror</i>, a Liberal paper, that instantly
obtained an extensive sale, and brought in to its founder
a net profit of £8000 a year. But his resolute advocacy
of Free Trade, free settlement, and free Press, and an
exposure of the misdoings of the East India Company,
brought down on him the heavy hand of Mr. John
Adams, the temporary Governor-General. His paper
was suppressed, and he was ordered to quit Calcutta.
His little fortune was sacrificed in a vain attempt to
fight the Governor and the Company, and he was
thrown back on the world, almost as poor, save in
experience, as when a youth he trudged from Corunna
to Lisbon. He left his magnificent library at Calcutta,
in the hopes of being able to return, after having
obtained redress at home. But the redress he hoped
for never came. Too many interests were involved to
accord it to him, and his library, like his fortune and
his hopes, was wrecked.</p>

<p>It was not till after many dreary years, that the East
India Company, under pressure from the Government,
could be induced, as an indemnity for the wrongs
done him, to accord him an annuity of £200, in addition
to one of the like amount awarded him by the British
Government, "in consideration of his literary works,
and useful travels in various countries," September 1st,
1851. "Pompey and Cæsar berry much alike."</p>

<p>"The blow to him at Calcutta was altogether a very
savage one," says Mr. S. C. Hall, "but, like all injustice,
it recoiled at length on those who gave it.
From the hour that Buckingham was driven from that
city (Calcutta), the power of the great Indian monopoly,
both commercial and governmental, was doomed. It
was by no means his case alone which accomplished
that doom. But oppression and vindictiveness, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
driving him home, made him for a time the representative
there of voices that never entirely slept;
whilst the impolicy that had aroused them was
persevered in to the last&mdash;not ceasing, even after the
trade was thrown open, but at length provoking that
rebellion which was followed by John Company finally
having to make an assignment of his whole estate and
effects to John Bull." In England Buckingham started
the <i>Athenæum</i>, a literary weekly, but did not long
retain it in his hand; he was not, in fact, qualified for
its editorship. He was a Liberal politician <i>avant tout</i>,
and a <i>littérateur</i> only in a second or third place.</p>

<p>In 1832, the Reform Bill was passed, and the same
general election that sent Wm. Cobbett to the House
of Commons for Oldham, sent James S. Buckingham
from Sheffield, for the avowed purpose of giving him
the best standpoint possible from which to assail the
East Indian monopoly. That Company had never
made a more fatal mistake than when it persecuted and
drove him from India. Buckingham was a theme for
caricature in <i>Punch</i> from 1845-1848.</p>

<p>It is open to question whether the East India Company
could have engaged J. S. Buckingham's services
if, instead of hounding him out of India, they had endeavoured
to secure a man of such exceptional ability
and intense resolution of purpose in its service. In
heart and soul he was opposed to a monopoly, and if
he had been engaged, he would have accepted an engagement
only for the purpose of remedying some of the
abuses of their government, and rectifying some of the
injustices done. But he was so utterly and conscientiously
opposed to the whole system, that it is more
than doubtful whether he would have met favourably
any overtures made to him.</p>

<p>In England an excellent conception of his, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
was able to realize, was the foundation of the "British
and Foreign Institute." To this he was moved by
seeing so many Orientals and others adrift in London,
without any centre where they could meet and communicate
their ideas with statesmen and politicians of
Great Britain, and where they might gather for refreshment
of mind and body alike. The Duke of Cambridge
became President, and the Society attracted to
its soirées the literary and intellectual of all lands.</p>

<p>His pen and his voice were employed for some years
in advocating reforms.</p>

<p>He died on June 20th, 1855, in his seventieth year,
and his wife died in the house of her son-in-law, Henry
R. Dewey, 22nd January, 1865, at the age of eighty.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that he did not live to
complete his Memoirs. He had two sons&mdash;James, who
died in Jamaica, 1867, and Leicester Forbes Young
Buckingham, who ran away with an actress, Caroline
Connor, and married her at Gretna Green, 5th April,
1844. She had made her first appearance on the
London stage at the Haymarket Theatre in 1842.
The marriage was not happy and they separated, she
to return to the stage, where she acted under the
name of Mrs. Buckingham White. He died at
Margate 17th July, 1867.</p>

<h2>MARY ANN DAVENPORT, ACTRESS</h2>


<p>Mary Ann Harvey was born in
Launceston in 1759, and was educated at
Bath, where she was seized with a passion
for the stage, and made her first
appearance on the boards at Bath as Lappet in <i>The
Miser</i> in 1779.</p>

<p>She remained at Bath two years, and during her
residence there is thus described by an eye-witness of
her performances: "Miss Harvey, about the years
1785 and 1786, was a lively, animated, bustling actress;
arch, and of exuberant spirits. Her style was pointed
and energetic; perhaps, indeed, she had less ease than
was altogether the thing; but when she had to speak
satirically or in irony&mdash;when, in fact, she had to convey
one idea to the person on the stage with her and
another to the audience, she was alone and inimitable;
she did not carry you away with her so much as
many young actresses that I have seen, but she always
satisfied you more amply. Then her voice&mdash;what a
voice hers was! Nay, what a voice she has still,
though it has had a pretty fair exercise for the last half
century and upwards. Then it had all the clearness
for which it is even now distinguishable; and it had,
besides, a witching softness of tone that knew no equal
then, and that I have never heard exceeded since."</p>

<p>There was an <i>espiègle</i> charm about her; she was not
exactly beautiful, but had a witchery of face and of
manner that was unsurpassed by any of her fellow-actresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
who may have possessed more regularity of
feature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2"><i>M<sup>rs</sup>. Davenport</i>,<br />

</div>

<p>She was not baptized at Launceston, S. Mary Magdalen.
Harvey was a common name at the time in
the place; a Harvey was a builder, another a hatmaker,
another a carrier. There were a Joseph Harvey
and Catherine Penwarden married 27th January, 1756.
These may have been her parents.</p>

<p>After leaving Bath, Miss Harvey joined the Exeter
company, and there met and married Mr. Davenport,
an actor of ordinary talent and low comedy.</p>

<p>After she had been married a short while, Mrs.
Davenport went to Birmingham, where she remained
a considerable time in hopes of obtaining an engagement.
But disappointed in this expectation, she accepted
an offer from Dublin, where Daly had opened
his theatre, and there she made her debut as Rosalind
in <i>As You Like It</i>, a character exactly suited to her,
and in which she aroused great enthusiasm. Her
graceful figure, her voice, now full of tenderness, then
of arch humour, and her expressive face admirably
suited the part. She moreover performed the part of
Fulmer in the <i>West Indian</i>. The <i>Authentic Memoirs of
the Green Room</i> for 1796 says: "Mrs. Davenport a tolerable
substitute for Mrs. Webb, though not near so great.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Davenports, tho' not of play'rs the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are far from being in old folks the worst."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1794 she first performed at Covent Garden, as
Mrs. Hardcastle, in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, and at
that theatre she continued without a rival till 1831, and
occasionally filled up vacancies at the Haymarket. Mr.
Davenport died in 1841; by him she had a son and a
daughter. The former died in India, the latter in
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>Robson, in <i>The Old Playgoer</i>, says: "Brunton being
the tall 'walking gentleman,' there is no one else
worth mentioning but dear, dear Davenport, most truly
not least though last. Lord! what a scream she would
give if she knew I was about to show her up! I can
just remember Mrs. Mattocks and Miss Pope....
But Mrs. Davenport was the McTab, the Malaprop,
the Nurse whose bantling, 'stinted and cried aye,' with
a villainous pain in her back, and a man Peter to carry
her fan; the 'old mother Brulgruddery'; the Dame
Ashfield with a 'damned bunch of keys,' who
immortalized 'What will Missus Grundy say to
that?' and would persuade a gentleman to put a
ham under each arm and a turkey into his pocket;
Jeremy Diddler's beautiful maid at the foot of the hill,
who 'blushed like a red cabbage'; heigho! all visions&mdash;all
gone.</p>

<p>"It was said of Mrs. Jordan that her laugh would have
made the fortune of any actress if she had not had the
wit to bring out one word to support it; but Mrs. Davenport's
strong point was her scream. I wonder whether
she ever indulged her husband with it in the course
of a curtain lecture! Mercy on his nerves if she did!
The appearance of her jolly red face was the presage
of mirth, and her scream the signal for a roar of
laughter. Good, cheerful soul! though an <i>old woman</i>
forty years, she outlived nearly all her play-fellows,
comfortably, happily, I hope."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>As an old lady her most celebrated personifications
were the Nurse in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, at which, in later
times, she was hardly surpassed by Mrs. Stirling.</p>

<p>The writer of the memoir in the <i>Georgian Æra</i> says
of her: "It has not been inaptly said of her, that in
the vulgar loquacity of the would-be youthful Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
Hardcastle&mdash;the ugliness of the antiquated virgin, Miss
Durable&mdash;the imbecility of four score in Mrs. Nicely&mdash;the
sturdy brutality of Mrs. Brulgruddery&mdash;the
warm-hearted cottager in <i>Lovers' Vows</i>&mdash;the attempted
elegances of Mrs. Dowlas&mdash;the fiery humoured Dame
Quickly&mdash;and the obtuse intellect of Deborah, she
overcame all rivalry."</p>

<p>In the edition of the <i>Authentic Memoirs of the Green
Room</i> for 1806 it is said, after a mention of Mr.
Davenport: "Wife to the above, and of primary
utility in a theatre as the representative of low, vulgar,
and antiquated characters. In this line she has not
her superior on the London stage. Her Mrs. Thorne
in the <i>Birthday</i>, Lady Duberly in the <i>Heir at Law</i>,
Dame Ashfield in <i>Speed the Plough</i>, Widow Warren
in <i>The Road to Ruin</i>, Widow Cheshire in the <i>Agreeable
Surprise</i>, Mrs. Pickle in the <i>Spoiled Child</i>, with a long
and diversified list of parts of a similar description,
deservedly rated high in the scale of histrionic excellence&mdash;and
what greatly enhances her value, she is not
less to be prized for the generality than for the intensive
merit of her performances. Wide and extensive
as is the range of parts which she sustains, there is not
a single character in the whole list in which she does
not acquit herself with distinguished talent and ability."</p>

<p>This bright and merry actress was run over by a
dray on July 20th, 1841, and died in S. Bartholomew's
Hospital on May 8th, 1843, after a lingering illness, at
the age of eighty-four.</p>

<h2>THE ROYAL FAMILY OF PRUSSIA</h2>


<p>"Over against Mousehole, across the great
bay of Penzance, is Cudden Point, jutting
out into the sea, forming one horn of a
promontory of which the Enys forms the
other, looking in the opposite direction. Between
these two lie three little coves, that of the Pixies, too
exposed and rocky for a harbour, but with its sides
riddled with caves.</p>

<p>"Bessie's, called after Bessie Burrow, who kept the
<i>Kidleywink</i> on the cliff, which was the great resort of
the smugglers, bears on its face to-day the traces of its
history. A spot so sheltered and secluded that it is
impossible to see what boats are in the little harbour
until one literally leans over the edge of the cliff
above; a harbour cut out of the solid rock, and a
roadway with wheel tracks partly cut and partly worn,
crossing the rocks below high-water mark; and, climbing
up the face of the cliff on each side of the cove,
caves and remains of caves everywhere, some with
their mouths built up, which are reputed to be connected
with the house above by secret passages.
These are the trade marks of Bessie's Cove, and the
world has not yet known the degree of innocence
which could believe that these were made for the convenience
of a few crabbers.</p>

<p>"The eastern and the most open is Prussia Cove.
Here still stands to-day the house in which John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
Carter, 'the King of Prussia,' lived and reigned from
1770 to 1807."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

   <p class="caption2">AT PRUSSIA COVE. "BESSY'S" COVE FROM BATTERY POINT<br />
<i>From a drawing by A. Chevallier Taylor in the possession of J. B. Cornish, Esq.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The origin of the Carter family is obscure. It is
supposed to have come from Shropshire, and the name
is not Cornish. But what could have brought it to
this wild and remote spot in the south-west is quite
unknown. The father, Francis Carter, was born in
1712 and died in 1774, and his wife, Agnes, died in
1784. They had eight sons and two daughters. The
eldest of the sons was John, the famous Cornish King
of Prussia. He obtained this nickname in the following
manner: He and other boys were playing at
soldiers, and the renown of Frederick the Great
having reached him, John dubbed himself the King
of Prussia, and the title not only adhered to him
through life, but he has bequeathed the name of
Prussia to the cove, which formerly bore that of
Porthleah.</p>

<p>John Carter, when he grew to man's estate, made
himself fame as a daring smuggler, and he was ably
seconded by his brother Henry, who contrived to his
own satisfaction to combine perfervid piety with cheating
the customs.</p>

<p>Smuggling in those days was carried on upon a
large scale, in cutters and luggers armed with eighteen
or twenty guns apiece. Harry Carter, in his autobiography,
says: "I think I might have been twenty-five
when I went in a small sloop about sixteen or
eighteen tons, with two men besides myself as
smugglers, when I had very great success, and after
a while I had a new sloop built for me, about thirty-two
tons. My success was rather beyond common, and
after a time we bought a small cutter of about fifty
tons, and about ten men." The measurements at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
the present day would be ten, eighteen, and thirty
tons.</p>

<p>John Carter was never caught. On one occasion
the revenue officers came to his house and demanded
to ransack his sheds. One of these was locked, and
he refused to surrender the key, whereupon they broke
it open, but found that it contained only household
articles. As they were unable to refasten the door,
the shed remained open all night, and by morning
everything it had contained had disappeared. The
"King" thereupon sued the officers for all his goods
that had been taken from him. It is perhaps needless
to say that he had himself conveyed them away. The
officers had to refund the losses.</p>

<p>On one occasion when John Carter was absent from
home, the excise officers from Penzance came to
Prussia Cove in their boats and succeeded in securing
a cargo lately arrived from France. They carried it
to Penzance and placed it under lock and key in the
custom-house. Carter, on his return, heard of the
capture. He was highly incensed, for the brandy had
all been promised to some of the gentry round, and
he was not the man to receive an order and fail to
execute it. Accordingly, he made up his mind to recover
the whole cargo. Assisted by his mates, in the
night he broke into the custom-house store and removed
every barrel that had been taken from him.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the officers saw what had been
done, they knew who the perpetrator was, for nothing
had been touched and removed but what the "King"
claimed as his own; and these smugglers prided themselves
on being "all honourable men."</p>

<p>The most famous episode in John Carter's career was
his firing on the boat of the revenue cutter <i>The Faery</i>.
A smuggling vessel, hard pressed, ran through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
narrow channel among the rocks between the Enys and
the shore. The cutter, not daring to venture nearer,
sent her boat in; whereupon Carter opened fire upon
her from an improvised battery in which he had
mounted several small cannon. The boat had to withdraw.
Next morning the fight was resumed, <i>The Faery</i>
opening fire from the sea. But in the meantime
mounted soldiers from Penzance had arrived, and these
fired from the top of the hill upon those working the
guns in the battery, taking them in the rear. This was
more than the smugglers could stand, and they
retreated to Bessie Burrow's house, and were not
further molested, the soldiers contenting themselves
with remounting their horses and riding back to Penzance.
Unfortunately, with regard to John Carter, the
"King of Prussia," we have but scattered notices and
tradition to rely upon; but it is otherwise with his
brother Henry, who has left an autobiography that
has been transcribed and published by Mr. J. B.
Cornish under the title <i>The Autobiography of a Cornish
Smuggler</i>, London (Gibbons and Co.), 1900.</p>

<p>But Harry Carter is somewhat reticent about the
doings of the smugglers, and avoids giving names, for
when he wrote "free trade" was in full swing. He
wrote in 1809, when John his brother and the "Cove
boys" were still at it, and Prussia Cove had not ceased
to be a great centre of smugglers. He is much more
concerned to record his religious experiences, all of
which we could well spare for fuller details of the
goings-on of his brothers and their comrades.</p>

<p>In 1778 an embargo was laid on all English trade,
when the French Government made a treaty with the
States of America, and not knowing of this, Henry
Carter was arrested at S. Malo, and his cutter, with
sixteen guns and thirty-six men, taken from him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
was sent to the prison at Dinan; and in like manner
his brother John was taken, and they were allowed to
remain on parole at Josselin till the November of 1779,
when they were exchanged by order of the Lords of
the Admiralty for two French gentlemen. "So, after
I was at home some time, riding about the country
getting freights, collecting money for the company,
etc., we bought a cutter about 160 tons (50 tons), nineteen
guns. I went in her some time smuggling. I
had great success."</p>

<p>In January, 1788, he went with a freight to Cawsand
in a lugger of 45 tons in modern measurement, and
mounting sixteen carriage guns. But he was boarded,
and so cut about the head, and his nose nearly severed
in two, that he fell bleeding on the deck.</p>

<p>"I suppose I might have been there about a quarter
of an hour, until they had secured my people below,
and after found me lying on the deck. One of them
said, 'Here is one of the poor fellows dead.' Another
made answer, 'Put the man below.' He answered
again, 'What use is it to put a dead man below?' and
so passed on. So I laid there very quiet for near the
space of two hours, hearing their discourse as they
walked by me, the night being very dark on the 30th
January, 1788. The commanding officer gave orders
for a lantern to be brought, so they took up one of my
legs as I was lying upon my belly; he let it go, and
it fell as dead down on the deck. He likewise put his
hand up under my clothes, between my shirt and my
skin, and then examined my head, and so concluded,
saying, 'The man is so warm now as he was two hours
back, but his head is all to atoms.' The water being
ebbing, the vessel (that was grounded) making a great
heel to the shore, so that in the course of a very little
time after, as their two boats was made fast alongside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
one of them broke adrift. Immediately there was
orders given to man the other boat in order to fetch
her, so that when I saw them in this state of confusion,
their guard broken, I thought it was my time to make
my escape, so I crept on my belly on the deck, and got
over a large raft just before the mainmast, close by
one of the men's heels, as he was standing there handing
the trysail. When I got over the lee-side I
thought I should be able to swim on shore in a stroke
or two. I took hold of the burtons of the mast, and
as I was lifting myself over the side I was taken with
the cramp in one of my thighs. So then I thought
I should be drowned, but still willing to risk it, so that
I let myself over the side very easily by a rope into the
water. As I was very near the shore, I thought to
swim on shore in the course of a stroke or two, but
soon found my mistake. I was sinking almost like a
stone, and hauling astern in deeper water, when I
gave up all hopes of life and began to swallow some
water. I found a rope under my breast, so that I had
not lost my senses. I hauled upon it, and soon found
one end fast to the side just where I went overboard,
which gave me a little hope of life. So that when I
got there, I could not tell which was best, to call to the
man-of-war's men to take me in, or to stay there and
die, for my life and strength were almost exhausted.
But whilst I was thinking of this, touched bottom with
my feet. Hope then sprang up, and I soon found
another rope, leading towards the head of the vessel in
shoaler water, so that I veered upon one and hauled
upon the other, that brought me under the bowsprit,
and then at times upon the send of a sea, my feet were
almost dry. I let go the rope, but as soon as I
attempted to run fell down, and as I fell, looking round
about me, I saw three men standing close by. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
they were the man-of-war's men seeking for the boat,
so I lay there quiet for some little time, and then crept
upon my belly I suppose about the distance of fifty
yards, and as the ground was scuddy, some flat rock
mixed with channels of sand, I saw before me a channel
of white sand, and for fear to be seen creeping over
it, which would take some time, not knowing there was
anything the matter with me, made the second attempt
to run, and fell in the same manner as before.</p>

<p>"My brother Charles being there, looking out for
the vessel, desired some Cawsand men to go down
to see if they could pick up any of the men dead or
alive, not expecting ever to see me any more, almost
sure I was either shot or drowned. One of them saw
me fall, ran to my assistance, and taking hold of me
under the arm, says, 'Who are you?' So, as I thought
him to be an enemy, made no answer. He said, 'Fear
not; I am a friend. Come with me.' And by that
time were come two more, which took me under both
arms, and the other pushed me in the back, and so
dragged me up to the town. My strength was almost
exhausted. They took me into a room where were
seven or eight Cawsand men and my brother Charles,
and when he saw me he knew me by my great coat,
and cried with joy. So then they immediately stripped
off my wet clothes, and sent for a doctor and put me
to bed. The bone of my nose was cut right in two,
nothing but a bit of skin holding it, and two very large
cuts in my head, that two or three pieces of my skull
worked out of afterwards."</p>

<p>He was now hurried off in a chaise to his brother
Charles' house, where he remained for a week. Then
as a reward of three hundred pounds was offered for his
apprehension, he was conveyed to a gentleman's
house in Marazion, where he remained concealed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
two or three weeks, and thence was taken to Acton
House, belonging to Mr. John Stackhouse, but only
for a while, and shifted back to Marazion. Then
again to the castle. The surgeon who was called in
to attend him was blindfolded by the men sent to fetch
him and conducted to the hiding-place of Henry
Carter.</p>

<p>In October he sailed for Leghorn, then on the same
vessel loaded at Barcelona with brandy for New York.
It was no longer safe for him to remain in England
till the affair was blown over, and he did not return
till October in the year 1790, and was soon again
engaged in alternate preaching in Methodist chapels,
and in smuggling brandy from Roscoff. On one of
these excursions in 1793 he was arrested at Roscoff, as
war had been declared between France and England.
This was during the Reign of Terror, at a time when
the Convention had decreed that no quarter should be
given to an Englishman, and an English prisoner was
placed on the same footing as a "suspect" or "aristocrat,"
and stood a great chance of losing his head
under the knife. He does not, however, seem to have
been harshly treated, only moved about from place to
place, sometimes in a prison, at others lodged in a
private house; a good many of his French fellow-prisoners,
however, suffered death. In his own words
and spelling: "There was numbers of gent and
lades taken away to Brest that I parssially know, and
their heads chopt off with the gulenteen with a very
little notice."</p>

<p>Robespierre was executed on 28th July, 1794; and
soon after his death the Convention decreed the release
of great numbers of "suspects" and other prisoners.
It was not, however, till August, 1795, that Henry
Carter got his passport and was able to leave. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
arrived at Falmouth on August 22nd. "Arived on
shore aboute three o'clock in the afternoon with much
fear and trembling, where I meet with my dear little
(daughter) Bettsy, there staying with her aunt, Mrs.
Smythe, then between 8 and 9 years old....
I staid that night at Falmouth, the next morning went
to Penryn with my dear little Bettsey in my hand. The
next morning, on Sunday, took a horse and arrived at
Breage Churchtown aboute eleven o'clock, where I
meet my dear brother Frank, then in his way to church.
As I first took him in surprise, at first I could harly
make him sensable I was his brother, being nearley two
years without hearing whether I was dead or alife.
But when he come to himself as it were, we rejoiced together
with exceeding great joy indeed. We went to
his house in Rinsey, and after dinner went to see
brother John (in Prussia Cove). We sent him word
before I was coming. But he could harly believe it.
But first looking out with his glass saw me yet a long
way off. Ran to meet me, fell upon my neck. We
passed the afternoon with him, and in the evning went
to Keneggy to see brother Charles."</p>

<p>The autobiography ends abruptly in the year 1795,
but the writer lived on until April 19th, 1829, spending
the last thirty years of his life on a little farm at
Rinsey.</p>

<p>In addition to the two authorities quoted, both due to
Mr. Cornish, there is a memoir of Henry Carter in the
<i>Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</i> for October, 1831.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN RICHARD KEIGWIN</h2>


<p>The English East India Company had been
founded December 31st, 1600, and it obtained
from Queen Elizabeth the exclusive
privilege for fifteen years of trading with
India and all countries to the east of the Cape of Good
Hope, in Africa and in Asia. The first settlement
effected was at Surat in 1612, by Captain Thomas
Best, who defeated the Portuguese in two battles. But
through the jealousy of the Dutch and their encroachments,
and the disturbances in England caused by the
Great Rebellion, the East India Company fell to decay.
Although Cromwell in 1657 renewed its privileges, the
English made little headway. On April 3rd, 1661,
Charles II confirmed and renewed all the ancient
privileges, and handed over to the Company Bombay,
which he had received from Spain as the portion of
Catherine of Braganza.</p>

<p>Dr. Fryer, a surgeon in the service of the Company,
travelled in India between 1673 and 1681, and has left
some graphic descriptions of it. He sailed from
Madras to Bombay, passing up the Malabar coast, and
noting how that the Dutch were elbowing the Portuguese
out of their posts. At last he entered the harbour
of Bombay, so called from its Portuguese name
Bona-baija. He found there a Government House, with
pleasant gardens, terraces, and bowers; but the place
had been meanly fortified, and the Malabar pirates
often plundered the native villages and carried off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
inhabitants as slaves. However, the Company took
the place vigorously in hand, loaded the terraces with
cannon, and built ramparts over the bowers. When
Fryer landed, Bombay Castle was mounted with a
hundred and twenty pieces of ordnance, whilst sixty
field-pieces were kept in readiness. The Dutch had
made an attempt to capture Bombay, but had been
repulsed.</p>

<p>Bombay itself was an island, with a superb landlocked
harbour, but it had at its back the great and
powerful kingdom of the Mahrattas.</p>

<p>But the vast expense of placing Bombay in a position
of defence had been so inadequately met by the
revenue derived from it, that the Company was dissatisfied
with its acquisition, and being, moreover,
burdened with debt, it had recourse to the unhappy
expedient of raising the taxation and reducing the
officers' pay. It was ordered that the annual expenses
of the island should be limited to £7000; the military
establishment was to be reduced to two lieutenants, two
ensigns, four sergeants, as many corporals and 108
privates. A troop of horse was to be disbanded, and
Keigwin, the commandant, was dismissed. This was
in 1678-9.</p>

<p>Richard Keigwin was the third son of Richard
Keigwin, of Penzance, and of his wife Margaret,
daughter of Nicholas Godolphin, of Trewarveneth.
The family was ancient and honourable. His great-grandfather,
Jenkin Keigwin, had been killed by the
Spaniards in 1595. Richard entered the Royal Navy,
became a captain and then colonel of Marines, and
was appointed Governor of S. Helena, then a possession
of the East India Company, by grant of Charles II.
After that he was transferred to Bombay, and had the
commandantship there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>He was highly offended at being thrust out of his
position, and he, moreover, knew that Bombay was
menaced by both the Sambhajee and the Siddee, both
of whom were desirous of gaining a footing on the
island, and each was jealous lest the other should
anticipate him in its acquisition.</p>

<p>In order that he might represent the danger that
menaced of losing Bombay Captain Keigwin resolved
on reporting in person to the Company
how matters stood, and he accordingly went to the
directors and laid the case before them with such
force that they consented to send him back to Bombay
with the rank of captain-lieutenant, and he was to be
third in the Council. But with singular capriciousness,
in the following year, when Keigwin was at Bombay,
they rescinded the order, reduced his pay to six shillings
a day, without allowance for food and lodging,
and made further reductions in the general pay and
increase in the taxes. This embittered the garrison
and the natives alike.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"During the greater part of the reign of Charles the
Second," says Macaulay, "the Company enjoyed a prosperity
to which the history of trade scarcely furnishes a
parallel, and which excited the wonder, the cupidity,
and the envious animosity of the whole capital. Wealth
and luxury were then rapidly increasing, the taste for
spices, the tissues and the jewels of the East, became
stronger day by day; tea, which at the time when Monk
brought the army of Scotland to London had been
handed round to be stared at and just touched with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
lips, as a great rarity from China, was, eight years
later, a regular article of import, and was soon consumed
in such quantities that financiers began to
consider it as a fit subject for taxation." Coffee, moreover,
had become a fashionable drink, and the coffee-houses
of London were the resorts of every description
of club. But coffee came from Mocha, and the East
India Company had sole right to import that, as it
had absolute monopoly of the trade of the Indian Sea.</p>

<p>Nor was that all; vast quantities of saltpetre were
imported into England from the East for the manufacture
of gunpowder. But for this supply our
muskets and cannon would have been speechless. It
was reckoned that all Europe would hardly produce in
one year saltpetre sufficient for the siege of one town
fortified on the principles of Vauban.</p>

<p>The gains of the Company were enormous, so enormous
as in no way to justify the cheeseparing that was
had recourse to at Bombay. But these gains were not
distributed among a large number of shareholders, but
swelled the pockets of a few, for as the profits increased
the number of holders of stock diminished.</p>

<p>The man who obtained complete control over the
affairs of the Company was Sir Josiah Child, who had
risen from an apprentice who swept out one of the
counting-houses in the City to great wealth and power.
His brother John was given an almost uncontrolled
hand at Surat.</p>

<p>The Company had been popularly considered as a
Whig body. Among the members of the directing
committee had been found some of the most vehement
exclusionists in the City, that is to say, those who had
voted for the exclusion of James, Duke of York, from
any claim to the crown of England on the decease of
Charles II. This was an affront James was not likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
to forget and forgive. Indeed two of them, Sir Samuel
Barnardiston and Thomas Papillon, drew on themselves
a severe persecution by their zeal against
Popery and arbitrary power.</p>

<p>The wonderful prosperity of the Company had excited,
as already intimated, the envy of the merchants
in London and Bristol; moreover, the people suffered
from the monopoly being in the hands of a few stockholders,
who controlled the market. The Company
was fiercely attacked from without at the same time
that it was distracted by internal dissensions.</p>

<p>Captain Keigwin now called upon the inhabitants of
Bombay to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown,
and to renounce the Company and submission to its
commands. With this the whole of the garrison,
militia and inhabitants, complied; the troops from
expectation of relief from the grievances of which
they had complained, and the inhabitants from anticipating
relief from taxation.</p>

<p>Captain Keigwin and his associates then addressed a
letter to His Majesty and to the Duke of York, expressing
their determination to maintain the island for the
King till his pleasure should be known, and enumerating
the causes which had impelled them to revolt&mdash;the
principal being to prevent Bombay from being seized
by the Siddee, or Admiral of the Mogul, who with a
numerous fleet was lying near, or else by the Sambhajee,
the Mahratta rajah, who was watching his opportunity
to descend on Bombay and annex it.</p>

<p>Captain Keigwin and the conspirators next represented
to the Court of Committee that the selfish
scheme of Josiah Child in England, and of his brother
John Child of Surat, had been at the bottom of the
whole mischief which caused the disaffection, and
added that both the garrison and inhabitants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
determined to continue in allegiance to the Crown
alone till the King's pleasure should be made known
to them.</p>

<p>But Keigwin was no match for the subtle and unprincipled
Sir Josiah Child and his brother John.
Josiah had been originally brought into the direction
of the Company by Barnardiston and Papillon, and was
supposed, and he allowed it to be supposed, that he
was as ardent a Whig as were they. He had for years
stood high in the opinion of the chiefs of the Parliamentary
opposition, and had been especially obnoxious
to the Duke of York.</p>

<p>There had for some time been interference with the
monopoly by what were called "interlopers" or free
traders, to the great vexation of the Company. These
interlopers now determined to affect the character of
loyal men, who were determined to stand by the Crown
against the insolent Whigs of the Company. "They
spread at all the factories in the East reports that
England was in confusion, that the sword had been
drawn or would immediately be drawn, and that the
Company was forward in the rebellion against the
Crown. These rumours, which in truth were not improbable,
easily found credit among people separated
from London by what was then a voyage of twelve
months. Some servants of the Company who were in
ill humour with their employers, and others who were
zealous Royalists, joined the primitive traders."</p>

<p>On December 27th, 1683, Captain Keigwin, assisted
by Ensign Thornburn and others, seized on Mr. Ward,
the deputy governor, and such members of the Council
as adhered to him, assembled the troops and the
militia, pronounced the authority of the East India
Company as at an end by formal proclamation, and
declared the island to be placed under the King's immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
protection. Thereupon the garrison, consisting
of one hundred and fifty English soldiers and two
hundred native topasses, and the inhabitants of the
island, elected Keigwin to be governor, and appointed
officers to the different companies, store-keepers, harbour-masters,
etc., declaring, however, that the Company
might, if their servants would acknowledge the
King's government as proclaimed, proceed in their
several avocations without molestation. Keigwin then
took possession of the Company's ship <i>Return</i> and the
frigate <i>Huntley</i>, and landed the treasure, amounting to
fifty or sixty thousand rupees, which he lodged in the
fort, and he published a declaration that it should be
employed solely in the defence of the King's island and
government.</p>

<p>But Child looked ahead, and saw that inevitably
James, Duke of York, at no very distant period would
be King of England. The Whigs were cowed by the
discovery of the Rye House Plot, and the execution of
Lord Russell and Algernon Sidney. It was high time
for Child to turn his coat, and this he did rapidly and
with dexterity. He forced his two patrons, Barnardiston
and Papillon, out of the Company, filled their
places with creatures of his own, and established himself
as autocrat. Then he made overtures to the
Court, to the King, and to the Duke of York, and he
soon became a favourite at Whitehall, and the favour
which he enjoyed at Whitehall confirmed his power at
the India House. He made a present of ten thousand
pounds to Charles, and another ten thousand pounds
to James, who readily consented to become a holder of
stock. "All who could help or hurt at Court," says
Macaulay, "ministers, mistresses, priests, were kept in
good humour by presents of shawls and silks, birds'
nests and attar of roses, bulses of diamonds and bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
of guineas. His bribes, distributed with judicious
prodigality, speedily produced a large return. Just
when the Court became all-powerful in the State, he
became all-powerful at the Court."</p>

<p>Against such machinations as these Keigwin was
powerless. Whatever Child asked should be done to
maintain the authority of the Company was granted.
Keigwin had appealed to hear the will of the King.
The King's answer was but the echo of the voice of
Child.</p>

<p>On the 31st January, 1683-4, President John
Child from Surat arrived off Bombay with some
commissioners, and met Keigwin with offers of pardon
for his rebellion, but the offer was indignantly refused.
Keigwin would deal with no one but the King himself,
and some plain truths were told to John Child, that it
was he and his brother, by their greed after gold and
indifference to the welfare of the settlement, that caused
all the trouble. The consultation lasted till March,
1683-4, and then Child had to return to Surat, without
having effected anything.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Court of Directors sent in a
report to the King, on 15th August, 1684, with a long
statement of its grievances, and a claim for protection,
according to the charter of the Society.</p>

<p>Charles II could do no other than order that the
island should be delivered over to the Presidency of
Surat, and a Commission under the Great Seal was
issued to President Child and to the commanders of
the Company's ships, empowering them to receive the
surrender of Bombay from Keigwin and his associates
and to offer a generous pardon to all, except the
four ringleaders, who should within twenty-four hours
after notice return to their duty.</p>

<p>Captain Tyrell, with H.M.S. <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, frigate, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
despatched, with Sir Thomas Graham as admiral,
to settle the affair.</p>

<p>But Captain Keigwin had no idea of resistance. It
had been further ordered that if Keigwin and his followers
should attempt opposition, all should be denounced
as rebels, and a reward of 4000 rupees should
be paid to any one who should deliver up Keigwin,
and 2000 for Alderton, and 200 for Fletcher.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Graham arrived in the Bay of Bombay
on the 10th November, 1684, and with great promptitude
landed without attendants, and had a conference
with Keigwin, who protested that he had only revolted
against the misgovernment of the Company, and to
save Bombay from being seized by one or other of the
Indian princes who were aiming to secure it. He at
once accepted the offer made to him of pardon, and
surrendered Bombay. He went on board the vessel of
Sir Thomas Graham and arrived in England in July,
1685.</p>

<p>During his enjoyment of power Captain Keigwin
had acted with integrity and wisely and judiciously.
He had relations with the native princes, and he showed
an amount of prudence and clear judgment that
eventually greatly benefited the East India Company.
He induced Sambhajee, the Mahratta rajah, to permit
the establishment of factories in the Carnatic
and allow them 12,000 pagodas as compensation for
losses sustained at places plundered by the Mahrattas.
Keigwin repressed the insolence of the Mogul admiral,
Siddee, with decision, and would neither suffer him
to keep his fleet at Mazapore, nor even to go there,
except for water. In fact, had the Company known it,
they had in Keigwin an admirable servant, a Clive
before the time of that hero.</p>

<p>But the directors were a number of commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
speculators who saw no further than a few years before
them, and were eager at once to be rich. They cast
this man aside, who, had they employed him, would
have made India theirs; and, a disappointed man, he
entered the Royal Navy and died at the taking of
S. Kitts, in the West Indies, in command of H.M.S.
<i>Assistance</i>, 22nd June, 1689.</p>

<p>It is one of the great mysteries of life and death that
men who might have revolutionized the world are
swept aside and hardly anything is recorded concerning
them. Richard Keigwin was one such, full of
self-confidence, vigour of character, restraint, and
judgment. But he lived at a time and under a reign
in which there was no appreciation of merit, and corruption
and self-interest bore him down.</p>

<h2>THE LOSS OF THE "KENT"</h2>


<p>The <i>Kent</i>, Captain Henry Cobb, 1350 tons,
bound for Bengal and China, left the Downs
on 19th February, 1825, with 20 officers, 344
soldiers, 43 women, and 66 children belonging
to the 31st Regiment; 20 private passengers and
a crew, including officers, of 148 men on board, making
in all 641 souls.</p>

<p>A gale came on in the Bay of Biscay, and the ship
rolled greatly. On 1st March the dead weight of some
hundred tons of shot and shells, pressed so heavily
with the rolling that the main chains were thrown
by every lurch under water; and the best cleated
articles of furniture in the cabin and the cuddy
(the large dining apartment) were dashed from side
to side.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the ship, with the well-meant
intention of ascertaining that all was fast below, descended
with two of the sailors into the hold, whither
they carried with them for safety a light in a patent
lantern; and seeing that the lamp was burning dimly,
the officer took the precaution to hand it up to the
orlop deck to be trimmed. Having afterwards discovered
that one of the spirit casks was adrift, he sent
a sailor for some billets of wood to secure it, but the
ship in his absence having made a heavy lurch, the
officer unfortunately dropped the light, and letting go
of his hold of the cask in his eagerness to recover the
lantern, it suddenly stove, and, the spirits communicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
with the lamp, the whole place was instantly in
a blaze.</p>

<p>Major (afterwards Sir Duncan) McGregor, who was
on board at the time with his wife and family, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I received from Captain Spence, the captain of the
day, the alarming information that the ship was on fire
in the after-hold. On hastening to the hatchway
whence smoke was slowly ascending, I found Captain
Cobb and other officers already giving orders, which
seemed to be promptly obeyed by seamen and troops,
who were using every exertion by means of the pumps,
buckets of water, wet sails, hammocks, etc., to extinguish
the flames. With a view to excite the ladies'
alarm as little as possible, on conveying the intelligence
to Colonel Faron, the commanding officer of the troops,
I knocked gently at the cabin door, and expressed a
wish to speak with him; but whether my countenance
betrayed the state of my feelings, or the increasing
noise and confusion upon deck created apprehension,
I found it difficult to pacify some of the ladies by
assurances that no danger whatever was to be apprehended
from the gale. As long as the devouring
element appeared to be confined to the spot where the
fire had originated, and which we were assured was
surrounded on all sides by water-casks, we ventured to
cherish hopes that it might be subdued; but no sooner
was the light blue vapour that at first arose succeeded
by volumes of black dingy smoke, which speedily
ascended through all the four hatchways, rolled over
every part of the ship, than all further concealment
became impossible, and almost all hope of preserving
the vessel was abandoned.</p>

<p>"In these awful circumstances, Captain Cobb, with
an ability and decision of character that seemed to increase
with the imminence of the danger, resorted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
the only alternative now left him&mdash;of ordering the lower
decks to be scuttled, the combing of the hatches to be
cut, and the lower ports to be opened, for the free
admission of the waves.</p>

<p>"These instructions were speedily executed by the
united efforts of the troops and seamen; but not
before some of the sick soldiers, one woman, and
several children, unable to gain the upper deck, had
perished. On descending to the gun-deck with one or
two officers of the 31st Regiment to assist in opening
the ports, I met, staggering towards the hatchway,
in an exhausted and nearly senseless state, one of the
mates, who informed us that he had just stumbled
over the dead bodies of some individuals who must
have died of suffocation, to which it was evident that
he himself had almost fallen a victim. So dense and
oppressive was the smoke that it was with the utmost
difficulty we could remain long enough below to fulfil
Captain Cobb's wishes; which were no sooner accomplished
than the sea rushed in with extraordinary force,
carrying away in its restless progress to the hold the
largest chests, bulkheads, etc."</p>

<p>The immense quantity of water that was thus introduced
into the vessel had, indeed, for a time the effect
of checking the fury of the flames; but the danger
of sinking was increased as the risk of explosion,
should the fire reach the powder, was diminished. The
ship became water-logged, and presented other indications
of settling previous to going down.</p>

<p>"The upper deck was covered with between six and
seven hundred human beings, many of whom from
previous sea-sickness were forced on the first alarm
from below in a state of absolute nakedness, and were
now running about in quest of husbands, children, or
parents. While some were standing in silent resignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
or in stupid insensibility to their impending fate,
others were yielding themselves up to the most frantic
despair. Several of the soldiers' wives and children,
who had fled for temporary shelter into the after cabins
on the upper decks, were engaged in prayer with the
ladies, some of whom were enabled, with wonderful
self-possession, to offer to others spiritual consolation;
and the dignified deportment of two young ladies in
particular formed a specimen of natural strength of
mind finely modified by Christian feeling.</p>

<p>"Among the numerous objects that struck my observation
at the period, I was much affected by the
appearance and conduct of some of the dear children,
who, quite unconscious in the cuddy cabin of the perils
that surrounded them, continued to play as usual with
their little toys in bed. To some of the older children,
who seemed alive to the reality of the danger, I whispered,
'Now is the time to put in practice the instructions
you have received at the regimental school and
to think of the Saviour.' They replied, as the tears
ran down their cheeks, 'Oh sir! we are trying to
remember them, and we are praying to God.'</p>

<p>"It occurred to Mr. Thomson, the fourth mate, to
send a man to the foretop, rather with the ardent wish
than with the expectation, that some friendly sail might
be discovered on the face of the waters. The sailor, on
mounting, threw his eyes round the horizon for a
moment&mdash;a moment of unutterable suspense&mdash;and,
waving his hat, exclaimed, 'A sail on the leeboard!'</p>

<p>"The joyful announcement was received with three
cheers upon deck. Our flags of distress were instantly
hoisted and our minute guns fired; and we endeavoured
to bear down under our three topsails and foresail upon
the stranger, which afterwards proved to be the <i>Cambria</i>,
a small brig of 200 tons burden, having on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
twenty or thirty Cornish miners and other agents of the
Anglo-Mexican Company.</p>

<p>"For ten or fifteen minutes we were left in doubt
whether the brig perceived our signals, or, perceiving
them, was either disposed or able to lend us any
assistance. From the violence of the gale, it seems
that the report of our guns was not heard; but the
ascending volumes of smoke from the ship sufficiently
announced the dreadful nature of our distress, and we
had the satisfaction, after a short period of suspense,
to see the brig hoist British colours and crowd all sail
to hasten to our relief.</p>

<p>"I confess that when I reflected on the long period
our ship had already been burning&mdash;on the tremendous
sea that was running&mdash;on the extreme smallness of the
brig, and the immense number of human beings to be
saved&mdash;I could only venture to hope that a few might
be spared; but I durst not for a moment contemplate
the possibility of my own preservation."</p>

<p>To prevent the rush to the boats as they were being
lowered, some of the military officers were stationed
over them with drawn swords. Arrangements were
made by Captain Cobb for placing in the first boat,
previous to letting it down, all the ladies and as many
of the soldiers' wives as it could safely contain. They
hurriedly wrapped themselves up in whatever articles
of clothing could be found, and at about 2 p.m. or
2.30 p.m. a mournful procession advanced from the
aft cabin to the starboard cuddy port, outside of which
the cutter was suspended. Scarcely a word was uttered;
not a scream was heard. Even the infants ceased to
cry, as if conscious of the unspoken, unspeakable
anguish that was at that instant rending the hearts of
their parting parents&mdash;nor was the silence of voices in
any way broken, except in one or two cases, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
ladies plaintively entreated permission to be left behind
with their husbands.</p>

<p>Although Captain Cobb had used every precaution
to diminish the danger of the boat's descent, and for
this purpose had stationed a man with an axe to cut
away the tackle from either extremity should the
slightest difficulty occur in unhooking it, yet the peril
attending the whole operation nearly proved fatal to
its numerous inmates. After a couple of unsuccessful
attempts to place the frail bark fairly on the heaving
surface of the water, the command was given at length
to unhook. The tackle at the stern was, in consequence,
immediately cleared; but the ropes at the bow
having got fast, the sailor there found it impossible to
obey the order. In vain was the axe applied to the
entangled tackle. The moment was inconceivably
critical, as the boat, which necessarily followed the
motion of the ship, was gradually rising out of the
water, and must, in another instant, have been hanging
perpendicularly by the bow, and its helpless inmates
in that event would have been shot down into
the boiling surf. But at that moment, providentially,
a wave suddenly struck and lifted the stern, so as to
enable the seaman to disentangle the tackle, and the
boat, dexterously cleared from the wreck, was seen
after a little while from the poop battling with the
billows on its way to the <i>Cambria</i>, which prudently
lay to at some distance from the <i>Kent</i>, lest she should
be involved in her explosion, or exposed to the fire of
her guns, which, being all shotted, afterwards went off
as the flames reached them successively.</p>

<p>The men had, accordingly, a considerable distance
to row. The better to balance the boat in the raging
seas through which it had to make its way, as also to
enable the seamen to ply their oars, the women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
children were stowed promiscuously under the seats,
and consequently exposed to the risk of being drowned
by the continual dashing of the spray over their heads,
which so filled the boat during the passage, that before
they arrived at the brig the poor creatures were crouching
up to their breasts in water, and their children
kept above it with the greatest difficulty by their
numbed hands.</p>

<p>However, in the course of between twenty minutes
and half an hour, the little cutter was seen alongside
the brig.</p>

<p>But the perils of the passage were not over; the boat
was heaved up against the side of the rolling and pitching
<i>Cambria</i>, and the difficulty of getting the women
and children out of the cutter and on to the deck was
great. Moreover, the boat stood in imminent danger of
being stove in against the side of the brig whilst its
passengers were disembarking.</p>

<p>Here it was that the Cornish miners on board the
<i>Cambria</i> notably distinguished themselves, and above
all Joseph Warren from S. Just, a famous wrestler.
Being a man of enormous strength, he stood on the
chains and caught first the children as they were tossed
to his arms, passed them up on deck, and then lifted
the women bodily from the boat as it heaved up within
his reach, and passed them over his head to the men
above.</p>

<p>The women showed great self-possession. They had
been urged to avail themselves of every favourable
heave of the sea, by springing towards the friendly
arms that were extended to receive them; and notwithstanding
the deplorable consequence of making a false
step, or misjudging a distance, under such critical
circumstances, not a single accident occurred to any
individual belonging to this first boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<p>Three out of the six boats originally possessed by the
<i>Kent</i> were swamped in the course of the day, one of
them with men in it; and the boats took three-quarters
of an hour over each trip, so that night settled down,
adding to the difficulties and dangers, and bringing
ever nearer the prospect of the fire reaching the powder
magazine and blowing all who remained on board into
eternity.</p>

<p>Sir Donald McGregor tells some pathetic stories of
the rest of the crew and passengers. One woman had
vainly entreated to be allowed to go to India with her
husband, and when refused, had contrived to hide
herself in the vessel as a stowaway till it was well out
at sea. As he was endeavouring to reach one of the
boats, he fell overboard, and his head, coming between
the heaving boat and the side of the ship, was crushed
like a nut in her sight. Sad instances occurred where a
husband had to make election between the saving of his
wife and that of his children. The courage of some
utterly failed them. Nothing would induce them to enter
or try to enter one of the boats leaping on the waves
beside the burning ship. Rather than adventure that
they would remain and take their chances on the wreck.
Some, making false leaps into the boats, fell into the
waves and were drowned.</p>

<p>At last all who could or would be saved were brought
on board the <i>Cambria</i>.</p>

<p>"After the arrival of the last boat, the flames, which
had spread along her upper deck and poop, ascended
with the rapidity of lightning to the masts and rigging,
forming one general conflagration that illumined the
heavens, and was strongly reflected upon several objects
on board the brig.</p>

<p>"The flags of distress, hoisted in the morning, were
seen for a considerable time waving amid the flames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
until the masts to which they were suspended successively
fell over the ship's sides. At last, about 1.30 in
the morning, the devouring element having communicated
to the magazine, the long-threatened explosion
was seen, and the blazing fragments of the once
magnificent <i>Kent</i> were instantly hurried, like so many
rockets, high into the air, leaving in the comparative
darkness that succeeded the dreadful scene of that
disastrous day floating before the mind like some
feverish dream.</p>

<p>"I trust that you will keep in mind that Captain
Cook's generous intentions and exertions must have
proved utterly unavailing for the preservation of so
many lives had they not been most nobly and unremittingly
supported by those of his mate and crew, as
well as of the numerous passengers on board his brig.
While the former, only eight in number, were usefully
employed in watching the vessel, the sturdy Cornish
miners and Yorkshire smelters, on the approach of the
different boats, took their perilous station upon the
chains, where they put forth the great muscular strength
with which Heaven had endowed them, in dexterously
seizing, at each successive heave of the sea, on some of
the exhausted people and dragging them upon deck.
Nor did their kind anxieties terminate there. They
and the gentlemen connected with them cheerfully
opened their stores of clothes and provisions, which
they liberally dispensed to the naked and famished
sufferers; and they surrendered their beds to the helpless
women and children, and seemed, in short, during
the whole passage to England, to take no other delight
than in ministering to all our wants."</p>

<p>Captain Cook of the <i>Cambria</i> at once turned the
vessel and steered for Falmouth.</p>

<p>On reaching Falmouth report of the distressed condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
of those who had been rescued was sent to
Colonel Fenwick, Lieutenant-Governor of Pendennis
Castle, and the people of Falmouth showed the utmost
kindness and hospitality to those who had been saved.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday after they had disembarked,
Colonel Fearon, all the officers and men, Captain Cobb
and the sailors and passengers attended church at Falmouth
to give thanks to Almighty God for their deliverance
from a fearful death.</p>

<p>Joseph Warren, the S. Just miner and wrestler who
had so powerfully assisted in the rescue of the unfortunates
from the <i>Kent</i>, strained his back in heaving up
the women on deck, that ever after deprived him of
power to wrestle or exercise his ancient strength. One
of the ladies whom he had rescued paid him an annuity
through the rest of his life, and he died at his old home
at S. Just-in-Penwith, 28th January, 1842.</p>

<h2>VICE-ADMIRAL SIR CHARLES V.
PENROSE</h2>


<p>The Penrose family is one of the most
ancient in Cornwall. The name signifies
the Head of the Moor, and it belonged
<i>par excellence</i> to the Land's End, where,
at S. Sennen, we find the Penroses seated as landed
gentry from the time of Edward I. They had branches
in Sithney, Manaccan, and S. Anthony-in-Meneage.
They mated with the best in the county&mdash;the Trefusis,
the Killigrews, the Eriseys, and the Boscawens. One
broke away from the circle of beautiful Celtic names,
and took to wife a daughter of Sir Anthony Buggs, Knt.
Happy must the lady have felt to cease to be Miss
Buggs and become Madame Penrose!</p>

<p>Charles Vinicombe Penrose was the youngest son
and child of the Rev. John Penrose, vicar of Gluvias,
and was born at Gluvias, June 20th, 1759. In the
spring of 1775 he was appointed midshipman on board
the <i>Levant</i> frigate, Captain Murray, under whose
command he passed the whole period of his service
during the next twenty-two years of his life, and who
(with one trifling exception) was the only captain with
whom he ever sailed, either as midshipman or as
lieutenant. In 1779 young Penrose was made lieutenant,
and was appointed to the <i>Cleopatra</i>.</p>

<p>All the summer and a part of the winter of
1780 were passed in cruising off the Flemish bank.
Captain Murray was then sent with a small squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
to intercept the trade which the Americans were
carrying on with Gothenburg by passing to the north
of the Shetland Isles. The biting cold made this a
source of extreme hardship, and the young lieutenant,
now first lieutenant, suffered severely. The illness of
the captain, and the incapacity of some of the officers,
threw on him almost the whole care of the ship, and
this under circumstances that required the skill and
caution of the seaman to be ever on the alert.</p>

<p>"I had, however," he wrote, "no time to nurse myself,
though I had pleurisy, besides my chilblains.
For these latter I used to have warm vinegar and sal
ammoniac brought frequently on deck, and, to allay
the raging pain, dipped thin gloves into the mixture,
and put them on under thick worsted mittens. At one
time rheumatism had so got hold of me that I was not
able to stand, but lay wrapped up in flannel on an arm-chest,
on the forepart of the quarter-deck, to give my
orders.</p>

<p>"On one occasion, in a severe gale, the ship covered
with frozen snow, the main topmast was carried away;
we were the whole day clearing the wreck, and I was
much fatigued but obliged to keep the first watch. We
were lying to under bare poles, and I had sent all the
men under shelter except one man at the helm and
the mate of the watch; and I had, with much difficulty,
cleared a place for myself between two of the guns,
where, holding by a rope, I could move two or three
short paces backwards and forwards. About nine
o'clock my messmates sent to ask if I would have anything,
and I thoughtlessly ordered a glass of warm
brandy and water, which they as thoughtlessly sent. I
drank about half, and gave the rest to the mate. In a
minute I felt a glow of warmth. Health, animation,
freedom from fatigue, all came in their climax of comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
The next minute I fell sleeping on the deck.
Fortunately for me, my comrade was an old seaman, and
he instantly knew my case and dragged me down the
ladder. I was put to bed; was badly treated, as I
was rubbed with spirits; but after excruciating pain,
I recovered. Had the officer of the watch been a
young gentleman without experience, I should never
have told my story."</p>

<p>In 1781 the <i>Cleopatra</i> was in the action off the
Dogger Bank, but in 1783 was paid off. "At this
time," wrote Mr. Penrose, "after having been for
eleven years conversant only with nautical affairs, I
really felt a great puzzle to know how a shore life could
be endured. I had entered into my profession with all
my heart, and was at this time as nearly a fish as a finless
animal can become."</p>

<p>In 1787 he married Miss Trevenen, the elder sister of
his brother's wife, and by her had three daughters. He
was not at sea again till 1790, when he accompanied
Captain Murray in the <i>Defence</i>, and was engaged in
the West Indies. At the latter end of 1796 he was
again returned to the <i>Cleopatra</i>, in which ship he had
the melancholy satisfaction of conveying to England his
friend and admiral, who had been seized with a paralytic
affection from which he never recovered. The
voyage home was tempestuous; but at length, and
nearly at its close, the wind had come right aft, and the
captain, who, though ill, was on deck, believed himself
to be making rapid way up the Channel. On a sudden
a light, which he knew to be the Scilly light, flashed
across him, and he saw that he was between Scilly and
the Land's End. He instantly stood to the south, but
had hardly changed his course when he saw, close
astern in the dark night, a wave break under the bow
of a large ship, steering exactly in the direction which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
he had left. "I never felt so sick before," he wrote.
"I felt certain that in an hour's time she would be on
the rocks, the wind blowing almost a storm. I shouted
through the trumpet, I threw up lights, and fired guns,
to give the alarm, but with the inward conviction at
the time that it was all in vain&mdash;and so it was. This
ship was never heard of again; and though fragments
of a wreck were found the next morning on the coast
near the Land's End, nothing was discovered to indicate
what wreck it was."</p>

<p>The <i>Cleopatra</i>, on her return to England, was laid
up for some months at Portsmouth in dock, and shortly
after her repairs were completed the mutiny broke out
at Spithead. Captain Penrose had the satisfaction that
his own crew, from the beginning to the end of this
anxious period, stood firm to their duty; a consequence
undoubtedly of the manner in which he invariably
treated his men, with kindly consideration and as
reasonable beings.</p>

<p>He now went ashore, as his health was broken, and
in May, 1798, went to reside at Ethy, near Lostwithiel,
where, so soon as his health was re-established, he
settled his family and looked out for fresh employment.
He was appointed early in 1799 to the <i>Sans Pareil</i>, of
eighty guns, and served in the West Indies till 1802,
when he returned to England, having suffered from
sunstroke. In 1810 Captain Penrose was appointed to
the chief command at Gibraltar, with the rank of commodore.
He hoisted his flag on board the <i>San Juan</i>,
and had to direct the proceedings of a large flotilla
which proved of great utility in the defence of Cadiz
and Tarifa, and in other operations against the French
under Marshal Soult. On December 4th, 1813, he was
promoted to be Admiral of the Blue, and shortly after to
superintend the naval service connected with Wellington's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
army, then advanced as far as the Pyrenees.
His orders were to proceed to the small port of Passages,
and there hoist his flag on board the <i>Porcupine</i>.
Admiral Penrose arrived at Passages on January 27th,
1814. The chief business which now devolved on the
naval service was to make the necessary preparations
for throwing a floating bridge across the Adour. This
bridge was to be composed of small coasting vessels,
decked boats, cables and planks. Above the bridge
were to be anchored for its protection as many gunboats
as could be furnished, and, to guard both these
and the bridge from fire-ships or rafts, a boom was
also to be laid across the river further up the stream.
These measures were consequent on the investment of
Bayonne. Great difficulties were to be expected in
passing the bar of the Adour, which, at the place where
the bridge was to be built, was four hundred yards
wide, and where the ebb-tide ran at the rate of eight
miles an hour. The Admiral determined to superintend
the operation in person. On the afternoon
of the 22nd the <i>Porcupine</i>, conveying some transports
and several large coasting vessels laden with materials,
left the harbour. But squally weather and baffling
winds came on during the night, and he was unable to
bring the flotilla to the bar before the morning of
the 24th.</p>

<p>The passing of the bar, a most perilous service, has
been described, as seen from the shore, by Mr. Gleig in
the <i>Subaltern</i>.</p>

<p>It was nearly high water, and the wind was fair;
both officers and soldiers gathered on the heights
around, and the passage of each vessel was eagerly
watched, from the moment it was immersed in the
foaming breakers until it issued forth in the placid
waters of the river beyond. Some few vessels broached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
to and sank; but, on the whole, the attempt fully
succeeded, and with fewer casualties than could have
been expected. General Sir John Hope, who commanded
on shore, said, in a letter to the Admiral:
"I have often seen how gallantly the navy will devote
themselves when serving with an army, but I never
before witnessed so bold and hazardous a co-operation,
and you have my most grateful thanks. I wrote to
you in the course of last night, to say how much we
stood in need of boats, seamen, etc., but when I saw
the flotilla approach the wall of heavy surf, I regretted
all I had said."</p>

<p>So soon as the boats had thus entered the river, no
time was lost in running those which were intended to
form the bridge up to their stations, where the bridge
was rapidly formed; and at dawn on the following day,
it was declared that infantry might cross it with safety.
On the 27th Bayonne was closely invested by Sir John
Hope, and Marshal Soult completely routed at Orthez
by Wellington.</p>

<p>On March 22nd Admiral Penrose received instructions
from the Duke to occupy the Gironde. On
the 24th he sailed in the <i>Porcupine</i>, taking with him
some brigs and a bomb vessel, and he was joined at the
mouth of the river by the <i>Egmont</i>, the <i>Andromache</i>, the
<i>Challenger</i>, and the <i>Belle Poule</i>. On the 27th he
entered the river, the <i>Andromache</i> taking the lead.
The want of pilots and the haziness of the atmosphere
rendered the navigation difficult. The course taken was
within easy reach of the shot from the enemy's batteries,
but these passed clear of the ships, and every considerable
danger was successfully overcome, when a clear
sun broke forth to animate the progress up the stream.</p>

<p>The abdication of Napoleon, 6th April, 1814, and the
restoration of the Bourbons followed, and Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
Penrose left the Gironde on May 22nd, and returned to
Passages to superintend the embarkation of the troops
and stores. The difficulties were great. The inadequate
supply of transports precluded the affording,
even to the sick and wounded, the accommodation of
which they were in need; and the hatred borne by the
Spanish population to the British troops burst forth
more and more as their strength diminished. Although
English blood and treasure had been poured forth to
assist Spain against the despotism of Napoleon and in
driving the French out of the country, not a spark of
gratitude was manifested by the Spaniards. It was
thought on this occasion highly probable that some
outrage would be attempted in the rear of the embarkation.
Indeed, a plan had been formed by some
Spaniards to seize the military chest, and for security it
had to be conveyed on board the <i>Lyra</i>, and a volley of
stones was hurled at the last boat that left the shore.
During Admiral Penrose's whole stay on this ungrateful
coast, he never received a visit or the smallest mark of
attention from a single Spaniard; and on his leaving
Passages, not one individual in the town was seen
to look out of a window to watch the sailing of the
fleet.</p>

<p>The <i>Porcupine</i> anchored in Plymouth Sound, September
6th, and the Admiral struck his flag on the 12th,
with but little expectation, now that peace had revisited
Europe, of being again actively employed. On the
16th, however, he received a letter from Lord Melville,
offering him the command of the fleet in the Mediterranean,
become vacant by the recall of Admiral
Hallowell. The offer was accepted, and on October
3rd Admiral Penrose hoisted his flag at Plymouth, on
board the <i>Queen</i>, and left Plymouth on the 8th.</p>

<p>Whilst in the Mediterranean, he heard on March 12th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
1815, of the escape of Napoleon from Elba, and of his
having reached Prejus.</p>

<p>In January, 1816, Admiral Penrose was promoted to
the rank of Knight Commander of the Bath.</p>

<p>On March 1st he received letters from Lord Exmouth,
who appointed a meeting at Port Mahon to proceed
against Algiers and Tunis to put an end to the piracies
that were carried on from these two places. The
squadron sailed for Algiers March 21st. Admiral
Penrose wrote: "On arriving at their destination, the
ships anchored in two lines out of gun-shot from the
batteries, and by signal made all ready for battle; but
all went off quietly, and the slaves in whose behalf the
expedition was undertaken were ransomed on the terms
which Lord Exmouth proposed." From Algiers the
squadron sailed for Tunis, and here also the Bey submitted
to the demand made on him, and thus ended
this impotent expedition. The Bey of Algiers was
by no means so overawed that he desisted from his
nefarious practices, and a second expedition was sent
against him under Lord Exmouth in 1816.</p>

<p>By an unfortunate oversight, rather than intentional
lack of courtesy, no notice had been sent to the Admiral
in command of the Mediterranean that Lord Exmouth
had been despatched to bombard Algiers and destroy
the piratical fleet. Admiral Penrose was at Malta, and
hearing in a roundabout way that Lord Exmouth,
with a fleet fitted out at home, had entered the Mediterranean
and was on his way to Algiers, he deemed it
advisable to leave Malta and visit this fleet. He did
not arrive off Algiers till the 29th August. The action
had been on the 27th, and the first objects seen on
entering the bay were the still smoking wrecks of the
Algerine navy, and then the fleet of Lord Exmouth engaged
in repairing the injuries which it had sustained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>Admiral Penrose was cut to the quick by the slight
put upon him, and he wrote to remonstrate with the
Admiralty, but received in reply only a rebuke for
expressing his indignation in a tone that the Admiralty
did not relish.</p>

<p>There is no need to attend Admiral Penrose in his
cruises and visits to the Ionian Islands, but his diary
may be quoted relative to an expedition made early in
1818, in company with Sir Thomas Maitland, to visit
Ali Pasha.</p>

<p>The history of this second Nero, with whom to our
disgrace we entered into alliance, and supplied with
cannon and muskets, may be given in brief.</p>

<p>Ali, surnamed Arslan, the Lion, was an Albanian
born about the year 1741. His father, driven from his
paternal mansion, placed himself at the head of some
bandits, surrounded the house in which were his
brothers, and burnt them in it alive. The mother of
Ali, daughter of a bey, was of a vindictive and ferocious
character, and on the death of her husband had the
formation of the character of Ali in her hands, and she
inspired him with remorselessness, ambition, and subtlety.
Ali assisted the Sultan in the war with Russia,
and was rewarded by being created a pasha of two tails
and governor of Tricala, in Thessaly. Soon by means
of intrigue and crime he obtained the pashalics of
Janina and Arta; then he was granted the government
of Acharnania, and, finding himself strong enough to
do what he liked, he attacked neighbouring provinces,
and banished or put to death in them all the Mussulman
and Christian inhabitants whose goods he coveted,
or who had given him umbrage. Then he attacked the
Christian Suliotes and massacred them. Previsa and
some other Christian towns on the coast had belonged
to the republic of Venice. In 1797 the Queen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
Adriatic, having been overthrown by Bonaparte, Ali
took the opportunity, at the feast of Easter, to descend
on them when all the inhabitants were keeping holiday,
and massacre over six thousand and plunder the houses.
The English Government entered into negotiations
with him, gave him a park of artillery and six hundred
gunshots. Thus furnished he attacked Berat, the
pasha of which was the father of his two sons' wives.
He took the place and threw the pasha into a subterranean
dungeon under his palace at Janina.</p>

<p>He seized on the Albanian towns of Argyro-Kastro
and Kardihi. The inhabitants of the latter surrendered
without striking a blow; but as they had at some
former time offended his mother, he put all the males
to the sword, and handed over the women to his sister,
who, after having delivered them up to the most
horrible outrages, had them stripped stark naked and
driven into the forests, where nearly all perished of cold
and hunger. When Napoleon fell, Ali got the English
to cede to him the town of Parga. It was concerning
this cession that the English Government thought it
no shame to send Sir Thomas Maitland to Ali to
negotiate with him at Previsa. "The General
embarked with the ladies (Lady Ponsonby, Lady
Lauderdale and her daughters) in the <i>Glasgow</i>, and
with the two ships we proceeded to the anchorage of
Prevesa. On the evening of our arrival I despatched
the second lieutenant to find at what time on the following
day Ali would receive us. His report of the chief
himself was wittily characteristic: 'He is exactly like a
sugar hogshead, dressed in scarlet and gold.'</p>

<p>"A long and heavy pull we had the next day in the
<i>Glasgow's</i> fine barge against a very cold wind, but at
last we reached the land. The palace of the ferocious
chief whom we had come to visit was built of wood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
on the water's edge, so that the boats landed at one of
the doors, contrived, no doubt, to enable the owner to
escape in that direction if requisite. It was an immense
building, badly finished, not painted, and badly
furnished, but calculated to lodge about three thousand
persons. The chief, with all his heads of departments,
and his son and grandson, received us in a small room,
one end of which was occupied by a comfortable and
well-cushioned divan. Here we were soon served with
coffee in beautiful china and gold cups and saucers, and
magnificent pipes.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas introduced me as the naval commander-in-chief.
Before we returned to our ships an excellent
collation was provided on a long table; but the climate
was severe in this wild mansion, and after trying many
bottles of execrable light wines, great was my joy in
finding a flask of excellent brandy.</p>

<p>"I had several good opportunities of watching the
countenance of the extraordinary man who was now
our host, and I never could observe the smallest indication
without of what was passing in his breast.
Simple benevolence was apparently beaming from the
whole expression of this human butcher. At one time
particularly, when I know for a certainty that he was
both angry and mortified at some turn in the investigations,
I sat opposite him at only a yard's distance, and
could not perceive the smallest outward token of the
storm within. He once questioned me about my
family, whether I was married, etc.; and when I told
him I had three daughters, 'What, no sons? Why
have you not them?' and burst forth into one of his
frightful haugh-haugh laughs, which were quite disgusting,
and resembled the grunt of a wild beast.</p>

<p>"As a high honour, on the day on which the ladies
were with us, he sat at the head of the table at dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
The dinner was much more profuse than elegant; and
one of Ali's first operations was to cut off the fore-quarter
of a roasted lamb, and with his hand tear out
the flesh between the shoulder and the breast, which
he devoured with great glee. Lady Lauderdale sat on
his right hand, and I was next her. Ali, understanding
that she chose some turkey, had one brought before
him, and helped her with a fore-quarter of an immense
bird, which, of course, puzzled her greatly. Whereupon,
bowing for permission from our host, I cut off a
proper portion from the wing, and helped myself to the
remainder. When Ali saw what a small portion I had
allotted to the lady, he grunted out his peculiar laugh,
but luckily did not persist in the cramming system.</p>

<p>"Even at this more distinguished feast good wines
were not the order of the day, and I had again recourse
to the brandy bottle. I know not what Ali had in a
particular bottle placed near himself, as he indulged no
one but Sir Thomas Maitland with a taste of it, but I do
not recollect hearing it praised. The chief took a good
portion of this bottle to himself, heedless of the Koran
and the prophet.</p>

<p>"Immediately after dinner dancing boys were introduced,
and performed a great number of evolutions,
showing the most extraordinary flexibility in every part
of the body. These poor creatures must have been
Nazarites from their birth, as their hair was long
enough to reach to the floor as they stood, and great
part of their skill was displayed in throwing about
these profuse locks with their arms. I think these boys
must have been of Indian extraction.</p>

<p>"The ladies having heard that Ali had bought a
diamond of great value from poor Gustavus, the ex-King
of Sweden, expressed a strong desire to see it.
He assented graciously, and ordered a plate to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
brought to him. He then searched in the folds of his
own fat neck, and at last untied a string to which was
affixed a little bag of either oil-cloth or bladder. Out of
this he took a coarse paper parcel, and having opened
the envelope, and three or four interior papers, he, with
a pretended air of indifference, threw out on the plate
a considerable number of diamonds, which some of
our party valued at £30,000. Among these was the
diamond of the ex-King, which had been valued at
£12,000; but owing partly to his necessities, and,
perhaps, partly also to a change in value, Ali purchased
it, I think, for £7000 or £8000.</p>

<p>"The strangest part of this story was that such
a man could display such a treasure, showing that it
was usually concealed about his person, before a considerable
number of his own subjects as well as
strangers. There seemed to be the freest possible
ingress and egress to and from the hall in which we
sat; and beside his officers of state, there were many
menials in the hall at the time. In what, then, consisted
the confidence which he must have felt? It
could not have been derived from conscious virtue, or
security of attachment; and, except at the gate which
led from the great square of the palace towards the
town, I never saw anything like guard or sentinel.</p>

<p>"Besides the dish of diamonds, Ali kept by his side
a brace of pistols richly set with valuable jewels, a
present from Napoleon; and in his girdle he always
wore a dagger, the hilt of which must have been worth
£2000 or £3000; one stone especially being very
large. Probably the reign of terror might operate to
some degree as a safeguard; but the appearance of
the people immediately about Ali's person indicated
much more confidence than fear.</p>

<p>"Our ladies had been introduced into the harem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
and to the favourite Fatima, who, as we were told, was
the best <i>scratcher</i> Ali ever had. One of his chief
luxuries was to have his immense, coarse carcase
scratched for a considerable time daily by his female
friends."</p>

<p>The end of this man, Ali Pasha, may be briefly
told. He had become independent, disregarding the
authority of the Sultan, and a menace to the State.
Accordingly an army was despatched to Janina, and
a fleet to make a descent on the coasts of Epirus. Ali,
in spite of his great age, exhibited great energy, and
prepared to resist, but his fatal avarice stood in his
way. With his enormous treasures he could have
secured the fidelity of his troops, but he could not
make up his mind to deal liberally with his defenders,
and most deserted. His own sons and grandsons, with
one exception, passed over into the enemy's camp. He
set the town of Janina on fire, and retired himself into
the fortress, which was defended by Italian and French
artillerymen, and which bristled with cannon. This
was in August, 1820. At the beginning of 1821 the
Sultan gave the command of his forces to Khorchid
Pasha, and the siege was begun. Ali had previously
sunk one portion of his treasure in the lake in spots
where it could be recovered by himself when the storm
blew over; the rest was in his cellar heaped up over
barrels of gunpowder, and a faithful attendant stood
ever by with a lighted fuse in his hand. Khorchid
was particularly desirous of securing the treasure.
He proposed an interview in an island of the lake.
After some hesitation Ali, who had now but fifty men
in his garrison, consented. The interview took place
on the 5th February, 1822; Khorchid had taken the
precaution to surround the island with soldiers, but
concealed. When they met, the officer of the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
produced a firman granting complete forgiveness to
Ali for all his crimes and defiance, on condition that
he surrendered some of his treasures. Ali then drew
off his ring, handed it to the general, and said, "Show
that to my slave, and he will extinguish the fuse."</p>

<p>Ali was detained in the palace on the isle till
messengers had been sent to the fortress, and the
slave, obedient to the token, had put out the light,
whereupon he was at once stabbed. When Khorchid
knew that the treasure was secure, he summoned the
soldiery, and they fired into the kiosk from all sides
and through the floor, till Ali was struck mortally.</p>

<p>The moral infamies of this man are not to be described.</p>

<p>When the negotiations with Ali Pasha were ended,
the Lord High Commissioner and the ladies returned
to Corfu, and Sir Charles Penrose went back to his
fleet.</p>

<p>He returned to England in 1819, being succeeded in
his command by Admiral Freemantle.</p>

<p>He again made Ethy his home, taking occasional
flights to London to obtain some other naval appointment,
which would not compel a severance from his
family, but none was available, and, finally, as his
wife's health and his own began to fail, he was content
to remain in his quiet Cornish home. There he died
January 1st, 1830, at the age of seventy; and Lady
Penrose died in 1832.</p>

<p>The Life of Vice-Admiral Sir C. V. Penrose, <span class="smcap">k.c.b.</span>,
together with that of Captain James Trevenen, was
written by their nephew, the Rev. John Penrose, and
published by John Murray, 1850, with portrait.</p>

<h2>SIR CHRISTOPHER HAWKINS, BART.</h2>


<p>Kit Hawkins, as he was familiarly termed
in Cornwall, played a considerable part at
the close of the eighteenth century, and
before the passing of the Reform Bill, as
a borough-monger. There was a contemporary with a
similar reputation, Manasseh Lopes, a Jew diamond
merchant from Jamaica, and both purchased their
baronetcies by subservience to the Government in finding
places for their nominees in the pocket boroughs
they had got into their hands. When Manasseh Lopes
drove into Fowey with his candidates, the town band
stalked before the carriage playing "The Rogues'
March"; when Kit Hawkins arrived in Grampound or
S. Ives with a carriage and four, and his candidates
with him, the band played "See the Conquering Hero
Comes"&mdash;but he conquered not with weapons of steel,
but with golden guineas, handed over to him by the
candidates, a share of which passed to the electors.</p>

<p>The Cornish Hawkins family pretended to derive
from a very distinguished Roman Catholic stock in
Kent, whose place, Nash, was plundered in 1715 by the
rabble, on account of the Jacobite proclivities of the
Hawkins family and the excitement caused by the rebellion
in Scotland of the Earl of Mar. On this
occasion all the family plate, portraits, and deeds were
carried off; some were burnt, some were recovered.</p>

<p>But not a shadow of evidence is forthcoming to show
that there was any descent of the Hawkins family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
in Cornwall from that in Kent. The story given out
was that on account of the religious persecution in
the time of Queen Mary, two of the Kent Hawkinses
left the paternal nest: one settled in Somersetshire
and the other in Cornwall, where each became the
founder of a family. It was forgotten, when this fiction
was given to the world, that the Hawkins stock in Kent
was Roman Catholic, and not at all likely to be troubled
by Queen Mary.</p>

<p>The first Cornish Hawkins of whom anything is
known is Thomas of Mevagissey, who married a
certain Audrey, her surname unknown, by whom he
had two sons, John and Thomas, and three daughters.</p>

<p>John Hawkins, of S. Erth, the eldest, married Loveday,
daughter of George Tremhayle, by whom&mdash;who
was living in 1676&mdash;he had four surviving sons and
three daughters, viz. Thomas; George, Vicar of Sithney;
Reginald, <span class="smcap">d.d.</span>, Master of Pembroke College,
Cambridge; and Francis. Thomas, the eldest, of Trewinnard
in S. Erth, married Florence, daughter of
James Praed, of Trevethow, near Hayle, by whom he
had a daughter, Florence, the wife of John Williams,
merchant, of Helston; and as his second wife he had
Anne, daughter of Christopher Bellot, of Bodmin, by
whom he had six daughters and four sons, of which
latter, John, Thomas, and Renatus died young, and
only Christopher lived. Thomas Hawkins, the father,
died in 1716.</p>

<p>Christopher Hawkins, of Trewinnard, only surviving
son, married Mary, daughter of Philip Hawkins, of
Penzance, a supposed descendant of the Hawkinses
of Devonshire, by whom he had a daughter, Jane,
married to Sir Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowaren, Bart.,
and a son, Thomas Hawkins, of Trewithen, M.P. for
Grampound, who married Anne, daughter of James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
Heywood, of London, by whom he had four sons&mdash;Philip,
who d.s.p.; Christopher; Thomas, who d.s.p.;
John, of Bignor, Sussex, who married the daughter of
Humphrey Sibthorpe, M.P. for Lincoln&mdash;and a daughter,
who married Charles Trelawny, son of General
Trelawny. Thomas Hawkins died on December 1st,
1770, and was succeeded by his second son, Christopher
Hawkins, of Trewithen and Trewinnard, born at Trewithen
May, 1758.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The seat Trewithen in Probus
descended to his father from his grandmother's brother,
Philip Hawkins, M.P. for the pocket borough of
Grampound.</p>

<p>Christopher Hawkins came in for a good deal of
land, derived through the marriage of the ancestors of
Philip Hawkins, of Trewithen, with the heiresses of
Scobell and Tredenham and that of his own great-grandfather
to the co-heiress of Bellot of Bochym.</p>

<p>Christopher never married, and was of a frugal
mind, buying land in all directions, and securing the
pocket boroughs, where possible, as excellent investments.
It was said of Trewithen&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A large park without deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A large cellar without beer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A large house without cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Christopher Hawkins lives here.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this was not fair, for there was certainly hospitality
shown at Trewithen. Polwhele says: "Not a
week before his death, I passed a delightful day with
the hospitable baronet. To draw around him the few
literary characters of his neighbourhood was his
peculiar pleasure; and at Trewithen the clergy in
particular had always a hearty welcome."</p>

<p>He purchased the manor of S. Ives in or about 1807,
the fair at Mitchell, in Enoder, commanding the election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
to that borough, and the four fairs at Grampound
giving him control there also over elections.</p>

<p>A good many of the Cornish boroughs had been so
constituted in the reign of Edward VI by the Protector
Somerset, that he might get his own creatures into
Parliament. Such were Camelford, Mitchell, Newport,
Saltash, West Looe, Bossiney, Grampound, and Penryn.
Queen Mary raised S. Ives into a borough in 1550, and
Elizabeth created six more to serve her own political
purposes, S. Germans, S. Mawes, Tregony, East Looe,
Fowey, and Callington.</p>

<p>Mitchell is a mere hamlet, and in 1660 the franchise
was solemnly transferred from the inhabitants at large
to nominees of the lord of the manor. In 1689 it was
determined that the right of election lay in the lords of
the borough, who were liable to be chosen portreeve
thereof, and the householders of the same not receiving
alms. But the borough in the latter years of its existence
became a battleground of many combatants, and
as the right of voting was, until 1701, left in great
ambiguity by successive election committees, the result
of the contest could never be predicted. In 1701, the
right of election for this distracted borough was again
changed. This time it was vested in the portreeve and
lord of the manor and the inhabitants paying scot
and lot. In 1784, Hawkins and Howell were elected
members, and sat in Parliament for Mitchell for twelve
years, till 1796, and Sir Christopher became by purchase
the sole owner of the borough; and after Howell
had ceased to represent Mitchell, he continued as its
representative to 1806, when he surrendered his seat to
Arthur Wellesley, subsequently Duke of Wellington.
The electors by this time had been reduced to five. In
the eleven years, 1807-18, there were nine elections at
Mitchell, not owing to feuds, but retirement of members.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
No event of importance occurred after 1818 to 1832,
except the extraordinary and significant revelation that
at the contested election of 1831, when Hawkins (Sir
Christopher's nephew) got two votes, Kenyon five, and
Best three. Five voters to return two members. In
1833 those five electors found their borough disfranchised,
a fate it richly deserved.</p>

<p>Penryn had been raised into the position of a borough
returning two members of Parliament, in 1553.</p>

<p>Mr. Courtney says of 1774: "About this period the
borough of Penryn began to be notorious through the
county for the readiness of its voters to barter their
rights for pecuniary considerations. The franchise was
on such an extended basis that almost every householder,
though many of these were labourers, indigent
and ignorant, was an elector." In 1807 there were, however,
but 140; in 1819 they had risen to 328. Each
got a "breakfast" and £24 for his vote.</p>

<p>In 1780, Sir Francis Bassett gave a feast to the whole
borough; he continued his patronage till 1807, as Lord
de Dunstanville. In 1802 Swann and Milford contested
a vacant seat in the borough, and Dunstanville to
secure the second seat had to resort to putting faggot-voters
on the poor-rates, the night before the election.
Petition being made against the election, it ended in
a compromise, and Swann received £10,000 besides
expenses. Lord de Dunstanville, disgusted at the
expense and the weakening of his influence, abandoned
the borough. Swann thereupon gave a "breakfast" to
his supporters; a "breakfast" was synonymous with a
bribe of £24. Penryn was concerned at the retirement
of its lordly patron, and founded a club in 1805 for
electors, such as would most conduce to the pecuniary
welfare of the voters. When the election of 1806 was
imminent and the former patron had withdrawn, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
deputation of the members was sent to Trewithen to
that notorious election-monger, Sir Kit, to tender to
him the goodwill of the constituency. "The details of
the negotiations conducted at this interview," says Mr.
Courtney, "became the subject of subsequent investigation;
but it was admitted that the voters stopped there
for four hours and dined at the baronet's table, which
on this occasion, no doubt, was more freely supplied than
according to local gossip was the custom on ordinary
days. The deputation informed Sir Christopher that
Mr. Swann&mdash;the Black Swan as he was called by his
enemies&mdash;who had been nursing the borough since
1802, must obtain one of the seats, but that the other
was at his disposal. These two worthy politicians,
Hawkins and Swann, thereupon coalesced, drink and
food were freely supplied; two voters, one for each
candidate, went round and gave each elector a one-pound
note to drink their health with, and the result
was that on the 1st November, 1806, the poll showed a
large majority for Swann and Hawkins over Mr.
Trevanion and his colleague William Wingfield." A
petition followed, and the evidence was of such a compromising
character that Mr. Serjeant Lens abandoned
the case on behalf of Hawkins. The evidence produced
was that the deputation of voters, headed by a clergyman,
which had gone to Trewithen to offer him the
borough, had associated with Sir Kit to sell their votes
and interest for twenty-four guineas apiece paid to
themselves, and for ten guineas to be handed to each of
the overseers, and that the offer was duly accepted.
An address to the King for the prosecution of Sir
Christopher Hawkins and eighteen members of the
committee was carried to the House of Commons. The
trial took place at Bodmin on the 19th August, 1808,
when Cobbett attended in person to watch the trial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
report proceedings in his <i>Political Register</i>. The
questions in dispute centred on the terms of the agreement;
the chief witness swore that the documents
signed by Hawkins stipulated that twenty-four guineas
should be given to each of the leaders of the party, ten
guineas apiece to the two overseers and twenty shillings
to each of the voters. But this evidence was unsupported,
no other of the committee could be induced
or intimidated into admitting that this had been the
agreement; no one in Penryn desired to kill the goose
that laid the golden eggs, and the defendant was acquitted,
"to dabble in borough-mongering for the rest
of his life."</p>

<p>At the election of 1807, Sir Christopher had no place
in Parliament, but Swann sat again for Penryn.</p>

<p>In 1812 Hawkins wooed the borough in vain, in
opposition to Philip Gell. The Black Swan was the
other member elected, but great indignation was
roused against him when it was found that he had left
his bills unpaid for treating and breakfasting his
adherents.</p>

<p>Then a committee approached Sir Manasseh Lopes,
but he declined to buy the votes at the price of £2000.</p>

<p>But Swann managed to recover favour and increase
the number of voters in his constituency by 200 votes,
and to form a company to provide granite from the
vicinity for Waterloo Bridge over the Thames, so providing
work for the voters of Penryn, and Hawkins
and Swann were returned. The usual petition followed,
and evidence of bribery came out. One voter
swore that he had received £5, and his wife another
£5; another £7; and many others various sums from
ten shillings to ten pounds. Swann was declared
guilty and imprisoned 1819-20.</p>

<p>In the election of 1827 it was admitted that £1850<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
had been distributed among the electors. Seventy
votes had been sold at £10 apiece.</p>

<p>Grampound had had its elections controlled by Lord
Eliot. In the election of 1796 the fifty electors received
for their votes £3000, and the patron, Eliot,
pocketed £6000 himself. The patronage was then
sold to Sir Kit Hawkins, to whom a friend wrote in
1796: "Fame speaks loudly of your doings. The
borough, by her own account, is all your own, and
such is certainly preferable to Tregony. The small
number of voters in one, and the vast number in the
other, pulls down the balance in favour of Grampound,
and from the continuance of Eliot we may infer that a
possession once obtained may last forty or fifty years."</p>

<p>But after the election of 1806 the recognized, nay
undisputed patron, Sir Christopher, keeping voters in
his pay, and holding the nomination to two seats,
found that his power was weakened. His candidate,
the Nabob Fawcett, did not pay as he had promised.
The electors accordingly determined to transfer their
favours to some other great man, and eventually
elected Andrew C. Johnstone, Governor of Dominica,
by twenty-seven over the Hawkins candidate, who
polled only thirteen.</p>

<p>"Up to this time," says the historian, "a decent veil
of reserve had been thrown over the delinquencies of
the Grampound electors; now it was cast aside, and
their deformities were disclosed to the view of the
whole political world. Enquiry followed enquiry, and
prosecution prosecution." The borough engaged the
attention of members of Parliament and Press correspondents.
Great Cobbett went to Bodmin in 1808 to
see the trial of Sir Kit, the Mayor, Recorder, and four
capital Burgesses. This petition unseated the anti-Hawkins
candidate, and a new writ was issued. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
was now arranged that Cochrane, patron of the anti-Kittite,
should give £5000 for one, or £8400 for the
two seats, to be distributed, and that each of the
elected should pay £12 10s. to the wives of the several
electors. Each voter eventually did get about £80.
The anti-Kittites polled twenty-seven, and Mr. Hawkins'
nominee fourteen. What does the Mayor do? Strike
off sufficient votes from the anti-Kittite, so as to give
the local baronet a majority of one, and returned his
nominees as duly elected. A second petition restored
Cochrane.</p>

<p>Sir Kit, discerning that his influence over the electors
at Grampound was passing away, determined to increase
the number of voters. The electors had consisted of an
indefinite number of freemen elected at Easter and
Michaelmas by the eligers. This election was artfully
deferred till good Kittites could be secured to fill the
places desired.</p>

<p>In 1812 Cochrane was still in possession, but he made
way for Johnston, associating Teed with him. This
man gave each elector £100 in promissory notes. Johnston
was, however, expelled the House in 1814 for
frauds on the Stock Exchange. Thereupon in came
Sir Christopher Hawkins again. He was again brought
before the notice of the House in 1818, when there
appeared six candidates. Innes and Robertson were
elected by thirty-six votes: the rest (eleven) went to
Teed. After that, on Teed's petition, the whole secret
of the nefarious system came to light. The voters, it
appeared, had applied to Sir Kit; but that worthy
baronet was tired of their solicitations, and refused to
advance a penny. So they turned to the Jew Manasseh
Lopes, who gave £2000 to be distributed among forty
electors. But when the money arrived, the Mayor intercepted
£300 for himself, another took £140, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
rank and file got only £35 apiece instead of the
expected £50; £8000 was paid privily by a sitting
member. Again a petition, and Manasseh Lopes was
convicted of bribery in both Devon and Cornwall, was
fined £10,000, and incarcerated at Exeter for two
years.</p>

<p>Lord John Russell was prepared to extirpate bribery,
and in particular to disfranchise Grampound; the
House of Commons agreed without a dissentient voice,
but the death of George III hindered proceedings, and
the last two members were returned.</p>

<p>S. Ives had been erected into a borough by Philip
and Mary in 1558. Here, after 1689, the Praeds,
Whigs, were all-powerful. In 1751, after long being
stewards of the Earls of Buckinghamshire, the Stephens
family began to assert itself. Thenceforth during the
long reign of George III a severe contest for influence
over the elections was waged between the two families.
In 1774 a Praed got ninety-five votes, a Drummond
ninety-eight, and Stephens was left out in the cold with
seventy-one. But the usual petition showed Praed's
corruption too manifestly. Money had been lent to
the voters, with the tacit understanding that in the
event of election it was not to be asked for, and forty
persons, sure voters for Stephens, had been omitted
from the rates. In 1806 Sir Kit Hawkins, gained a
share in representation; his candidate, Horner. But
Stephens got 135 votes and Horner 128; the other
candidate opposing him was left far in the rear, with
only five votes. But Horner was out again at the next
election. In 1820 Sir Christopher had the appointment
to both seats entirely in his own hands.</p>

<p>Tregony had been made into a borough under Queen
Elizabeth in 1562. Before 1832 it was described as
"destitute of trade, wealth, and common activity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing in 1877, the last Cornish historian remarks
that the condition of Tregony had passed from bad to
worse. Many of its houses were then in ruins, and the
scene of desolation was spreading. In early times
Tregony had been a seaport on a tidal creek, but that
was silted up, and no boat could now reach it, so that
its commercial importance was wholly gone.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the representatives of
Tregony were men of little importance, small placemen
unconnected with Cornwall. In the long array of
aliens and Court satellites, the name of one Cornish
gentleman stands out in bright relief; 1747-67, for
twenty years (a long period) Mr. Trevanion represented
it. The election of 1774 excited much notice.
Lord North advised a note to be written to Lord
Falmouth: "His Lordship must be told in as polite
terms as possible, that I hope he will permit me to
recommend to three of his six seats in Cornwall. The
terms he expects are £2000 a seat, to which I am ready
to agree." Later on, he says that his candidate
Pownall must get in for Lostwithiel, and Conway
represent Tregony, and he added: "My noble friend
(Falmouth) is rather shabby, desiring guineas instead
of pounds," but signified his will to pay rather than
drop the bargain. Again: "Gascoyne shall have the
refusal of Tregony for £1000," and the Minister complained
that he saw no way of bringing him in at a
cheaper rate than any other servant of the Crown.</p>

<p>In 1776 the Boscawen influence was sold to Sir
Kit Hawkins, but he did not retain it for long,
for he disposed of it to a Nabob, Barwell, and the
two continued on friendly terms. When the living of
Cuby fell vacant&mdash;Cuby is the parish church of
Tregony&mdash;Sir Kit asked Barwell, who now had the
presentation, to give it to a friend of his, alleging that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
"he had great interest" and assuring Barwell that his
clerical friend would reside in the place, and by his
great activity in the borough prevent, if possible, any
opposition arising to Mr. Barwell. But at the very
next election Sir Kit ran and returned two members
against Barwell.</p>

<p>In the contest of 1784, Lord Kenyon, a lawyer,
obtained the seat by purchase, polling 90, while his
two opponents got 69 each.</p>

<p>In 1806 an O'Callinghan and a Yorkshire Whig,
through Darlington's interest polled against Barwell's
interest 102 against 86. At this election the following
trick was played. A Tregony tailor and publican,
called Middlecoat, offered to seat Sir Jonathan Miles for
4000 guineas. At the poll the returning officer, who
was biased or had been tampered with, struck off
many good votes from Miles, and gave bad ones to
others. Sir Jonathan petitioned and, for the expenses
of the petition, sent Middlecoat a large sum of money,
and he prevented the witnesses from appearing, and the
sitting members were accordingly pronounced to be
duly elected. Middlecoat had secured £2500 from
the sitting nominees (Barwellians) to keep back the
witnesses, as well as £4200 from Sir Jonathan to bring
them forward.</p>

<p>In 1812 O'Callinghan was unseated, and petitioned,
showing that £5000 had been distributed among the
voters; nevertheless the sitting members were received.
Holmes, one of them, said&mdash;to show what was the
degraded condition of the borough&mdash;that out of 127
votes in his favour, 98 had been evicted into the street
the day after the election, some having been called on
to pay their rents, but were unable to do so at the
moment, and others, whose annual rents were only £8,
had been mulcted in costs to the extent of £98.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<p>Middlecoat, and four others of like spirit, went to
London in 1818 to search for candidates for Tregony
and Grampound, offering the former for £6000 and
the latter for £7000. A banker and a general came
down before the election, but found that the voters
would make no promise unless the money were paid
down. So they had to return to London "proclaiming
their disappointment at every turn, and cursing the
scoundrels who would not trust them."</p>

<p>Christopher Hawkins was returned for Mitchell in
1784, re-elected in 1790 and 1796. In June, 1799, he
vacated his seat by accepting the Stewardship of the
Chiltern Hundreds. In August, 1800, he was elected
for Grampound, again in 1802 and 1806. In 1818 he
was returned for Penryn, and in June, 1821, for S. Ives.
He was created baronet on July 28th, 1791. He
was Recorder of Grampound and S. Ives and, at the
time when he relinquished his seat finally, he was the
father of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher encouraged the famous engineer and
inventor Richard Trevithick, and in the life of that
worthy, by Francis Trevithick, are given some letters
that passed between them; but Mr. F. Trevithick persistently
calls Sir Christopher Sir Charles. Sir Kit
was the first man to adopt a steam thrashing-machine
in 1812, an invention of Trevithick; it was used for
the first time at Trewithen in February in that year.
A committee of experts was called in to witness its
operations and report on them, and this is their report,
dated February 12th, 1812:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having been requested to witness and report on
the effect of steam applied to work a mill for thrashing
corn at Trewithen, we hereby testify that a fire was
lighted under the boiler of the engine five minutes after
eight o'clock, and at twenty-five minutes after nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
o'clock the thrashing mill began to work, in which time
one bushel of coal was consumed. That from the time
the mill began to work to two minutes after two
o'clock, being four hours and three-quarters, fifteen
hundred sheaves of barley were thrashed clean, and one
bushel of coal more was consumed. We think there
was sufficient steam remaining in the boiler to have
thrashed from fifty to one hundred sheaves more barley,
and the water in the boiler was by no means exhausted.
We had the satisfaction to observe that common
labourers regulated the thrashing mill, and in a
moment of time made it go faster, slower, or entirely
cease working. We approve of the steadiness and
the velocity with which the machine worked, and in
every respect we prefer the power of steam, as here
applied, to that of horse.</p>

</p>

<p>Sir Christopher entered into negotiation with Trevithick
about constructing a breakwater to the harbour
at S. Ives, at Pendinas Point. It was begun, but
never completed, owing to the death of the baronet.
But a good thing he did achieve, though done for a
political purpose, by indirect bribery, was the establishment
of a free school at S. Ives, in Shute Street;
the charge of admission was one penny per week, and
in it navigation was taught. It was opened on April
11th, 1822.</p>

<p>In the diary of Captain John Tregerthen Short of the
events taking place at S. Ives between 1817 and 1838 we
have: "1828, June 10th. At 10 a.m. Sir Christopher
Hawkins, Bart., and Wellesley Long Pole, Esq., the
former supporting the cause of the Right Hon. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
Charles Arbuthnot, attended at the Town Hall, where
Wellesley Long Pole, Esq., resigned the contest, and
Sir Charles Arbuthnot was elected without opposition.
Immediately afterwards Mr. Wellesley Pole made an
active and successful canvass of the town for another
election, and left S. Ives at 10 p.m., having given each
voter 5s., and Sir Christopher Hawkins gave all his
friends 5s."</p>

<p>"July 21st.&mdash;All Mr. Wellesley's voters had a public
dinner; each received one guinea to defray the expense
of the dinner, which came to 7s. 3d. per man." Oh,
what a falling off is here! Only 5s. each voter, whereas
elsewhere, at Grampound, Tregony, Penryn, and
Mitchell, a free and independent elector would turn up
his nose at £10. But Captain Short does not inform us
what the <i>douceurs</i> had been that were paid previous to
the election.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Hawkins died of erysipelas at Trewithen
on April 6th, 1829.</p>

<p>Captain Short enters on that day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., departed this
life this morning in the seventy-first year of his
age. His death will be greatly felt and deplored
by hundreds. His charitable contributions amongst
the indigent will be found greatly wanting. A
more generous and benevolent landlord could not
be found. He was never known to distrain for
rent. He established a Free School in S. Ives for
the education of the poor, and gave the sum of £100
towards enlarging the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel
in this town."</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1830 says that Sir Kit
Hawkins's property at S. Ives was sold then, "which
secures the purchaser a seat in Parliament, for the
borough was lately sold by auction in London for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
the sum of £55,000. It is reported that the purchaser
is the Marquess of Cleveland."</p>

<p>A bad bargain, for three years after the Reform
Bill was passed, and S. Ives ceased to be a pocket
borough.</p>

<h2>ANNE JEFFERIES</h2>


<p>Moses Pitt, a publisher in London, a
native of S. Teath, in 1696 published
the following letter to the Bishop of
Gloucester. There are two editions of
it, with slight and insignificant variations both in
the preliminary address and in the account of Anne
Jefferies.</p>

<p>The preamble we omit.</p>

<p>"Anne Jefferies (for that was her maiden name),
of whom the following strange things are related,
was born in the parish of S. Teath, in the county of
Cornwall, in December, 1626, and she is still living
in 1696, being in the seventieth year of her age. She
is married to one William Warren, formerly hind to
the late eminent physician Dr. Richard Lewes,
deceased, and now lives as a hind to Sir Andrew
Slanning, of Devon, Bart.</p>

<p>"In the year 1691 I wrote into Cornwall to my
sister Mary Martyn's son, attorney, to go to the said
Anne and discourse her, as from me, about the most
strange passages of her life. He answers my letter
September 13th, 1691, and saith: 'I have been with
Anne Jefferies, and she can give me no particular
account of her condition, it being so long since. My
grandmother and mother say that she was in Bodmin
jail three months, and lived six months without meat;
and during her continuance in that condition several
eminent cures were performed by her; the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
no one can now state. My mother saw the fairies once,
and heard one say that they should give some meat to
the child, that she might return unto her parents,
which is the fullest relation can now be given.' But
I, not being satisfied with the answer, did in the
year 1693 write into Cornwall and my sister's husband,
Mr. Humphry Martyn, and desired him to go to Anne
Jefferies to see if he could persuade her to give me
what account she could remember of the many and
strange passages of her life. He answered by letter,
January 31st, 1693, and saith: 'As for Anne Jefferies,
I have been with her the greatest part of one day, and
did read to her all that you wrote to me; but she would
not own anything of it as concerning the fairies, neither
of the cures she then did. I endeavoured to persuade
her she might receive some benefit by it. She answered
that if her own father were now alive she would not
discover to him those things which did happen to her.
I asked her the reason why she would not do it; she
replied that if she should discover it to you, that you
would make either books or ballads of it; and she said
that she would not have her name spread about the
country in books or ballads, or such things, if she
might have £500 for doing it; for she said she had
been questioned before justices, and at the sessions,
and in prison, and also before the judges at the assizes,
and she doth believe that if she should discover such
things now she would be questioned again for it. As
for the ancient inhabitants of S. Teath Church-town,
there are none of them now alive but Thomas
Christopher, a blind man. (<span class="smcap">Note</span>: This Thomas
Christopher was then a servant in my father's house,
when these things happened, and he remembers many
of the passages you write of her.) And as for my wife,
she then being so little did not mind it, but heard her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
father and mother relate most of the passages you
wrote of her.'</p>

<p>"This is all I can, at present, possibly get from her,
and therefore I now go on with my relation of the
wonderful cures and other strange things she did,
or happened to her, which is the substance of what
I wrote to my brother and that he read to her.</p>

<p>"It is the custom in our county of Cornwall for
the most substantial people of each parish to take
apprentices the poor children, and to breed them up
till they attain to twenty-one years of age, and for their
services to give them meat, drink, and clothes. This
Anne Jefferies, being a poor man's child of the parish,
by Providence fell into our family, where she lived
many years. Being a girl of a bold, daring spirit, she
would venture at those difficulties and dangers that no
boy would attempt.</p>

<p>"In the year 1645 (she being nineteen years old), she
being one day knitting in an arbour in our garden,
there came over the hedge to her, as she affirmed, six
persons of small stature, all clothed in green, which
she called fairies. Upon which she was so frightened
that she fell into a kind of convulsive fit. But when we
found her in this condition, we brought her into the
house and put her to bed, and took great care of her.
As soon as she recovered out of her fit she cried out,
'They are just gone out of the window! Do you not
see them?' And thus in the height of her sickness she
would often cry out, and that with eagerness, which
expressions were attributed to her distemper, supposing
her light-headed. During the extremity of her sickness
my father's mother died, which was in April,
1646; he durst not acquaint our maid Anne of it for
fear it might have increased her distemper, she being
at that time so very sick that she could not go, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
so much as stand on her feet; and also the extremity
of her sickness, and the long continuance of her distemper
had almost perfectly moped her, so that she
became even as a changeling; and as soon as she began
to recover, or to get a little strength, she in her going
would spread her legs as wide as she could, and
so lay hold with her hands on tables, chairs, forms,
stools, etc., till she had learnt to go again; and if
anything vexed her, she would fall into her fits, and
continue in them for a long time, so that we were
afraid she would have died in one of them.</p>

<p>"As soon as she recovered a little strength she
constantly went to church to pay her devotions to
our great and good God. She took mighty delight in
devotion and in hearing the Word of God read and
preached, although she herself could not read. The
first manual operation or cure she performed was on
my mother. The occasion was as follows: One afternoon
in the harvest time, all our family being in the
fields at work (and myself a boy at school), there was
none in the house but my mother and this Anne. My
mother, considering that bread might be a-wanting for
the labourers, if care were not taken, and she having
before caused some bushels of wheat to be sent to the
mill, which was but a quarter of a mile from our
house, desired to hasten the miller to bring home the
meal, that so her maids as soon as they came from the
fields might make and bake the bread; but in the
meantime how to dispose of her maid Anne was her
great care, for she did not dare trust her in the house
alone, for fear she might do herself some mischief by
fire, or set the house on fire, for at that time she was
so weak that she could hardly help herself, and very
silly withal. At last, by much persuasion, my
mother prevailed with her to walk in the gardens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
orchard till she came from the mill, to which she
willingly consented. Then my mother locked the door
of the house and walked to the mill; but as she was
coming home, she slipped and hurt her leg, so as that
she could not rise. There she lay a considerable time
in great pain, till a neighbour, coming by on horseback,
seeing my mother in this condition, lifted her
upon his horse. As soon as she was brought within
doors of the house, word was sent into the fields to the
reapers, who thereupon immediately left their harvest
work and came home. The house being presently full
of people, a man-servant was ordered to take a horse
and ride for Mr. Lobb, an eminent surgeon who then
lived at Bodmin, which was eight miles from my
father's house. But, while the man was getting the
horse ready, in comes our maid Anne, and tells my
mother that she was heartily sorry for the mischance she
had got in hurting her leg, and that she did it at such a
place, naming the place, and further, she desired she
might see her leg. My mother at first refused to show
her leg, saying to her, What should she show her leg
to so poor and silly a creature as she was, for she
could do her no good. But Anne being very importunate
with my mother to see her leg, and my
mother being unwilling to vex her by denying her, for
fear of her falling into her fits, for at all times we dealt
gently, lovingly, and kindly with her, did yield to her
request, and did show her her leg.</p>

<p>"Upon which Anne took my mother's leg upon her
lap and stroked it with her hand, and then asked my
mother if she did not find ease by her stroking of it?
My mother confessed to her she did. Upon this she
desired my mother to forbear sending for the surgeon,
for she would, by the blessing of God, cure her
leg. And to satisfy my mother of the truth of it, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
again appealed to my mother whether she did not find
further ease upon her continued stroking of the part
affected. Which my mother again acknowledged she
did. Upon this my mother countermanded the messenger
for the surgeon. On this my mother demanded
of her how she came to the knowledge of her fall. She
made answer that half a dozen persons had told her
of it. 'That,' replied my mother, 'could not be, for
there were none came by at that time but my neighbour,
who brought me home.' Anne answers again
that that was truth, and it was also true that half a
dozen persons told her so, for, said she, 'you know
I went out of the house into the garden and orchard
very unwillingly; and now I will tell you the truth
of all matters and things that have befallen me. You
know that this my sickness and fits came very suddenly
upon me, which brought me very low and weak, and
have made me very simple. Now the cause of my
sickness was this: I was one day knitting of stockings
in the arbour of the garden, and there came over the
garden hedge of a sudden six small people, all in green
clothes, which put me into such a great fright that
was the cause of my sickness; and they continue their
appearance to me, never less than two at a time nor
more than eight. They always appear in even numbers&mdash;2,
4, 6, 8. When I said often in my sickness
they were just gone out of the window, it was really
so, although you thought me light-headed. At this
time, when I came out into the garden, they came to
me and asked me if you had put me out of the house
against my will. I told them I was unwilling to come
out of the house. Upon this they said you should not
fare better for it, and thereupon, in that place and
at that time, in a fair pathway you fell and hurt your
leg. I would not have you send for a surgeon nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
trouble yourself, for I will cure your leg.' The which
she did in a little time.</p>

<p>"This cure of my mother's leg, and the stories she
told of those fairies, made a noise all over the county
of Cornwall. People of all distempers, sicknesses,
sores, and ages came not only so far off as the Land's
End, but also from London, and were cured by her.
She took no money of them nor any reward that
ever I knew or heard of, yet had she monies at all
times, sufficient to supply her wants. She neither made
nor bought any medicines or salves that ever I saw
or heard of, yet wanted them not as she had occasion.
She forsook eating our victuals and was fed by those
fairies from the harvest time to the next Christmas
Day, upon which day she came to our table and said
because it was that day she would eat some roast beef
with us, the which she did, I myself being then at the
table.</p>

<p>"One time (I remember it perfectly well) I had a
mind to speak with her, and not knowing better where
to find her than in her chamber, I went thither, and
fell a-knocking very earnestly at her chamber door with
my foot, and calling to her earnestly 'Anne! Anne!
open the door and let me in.' She answered me, 'Have
a little patience and I will let you in, immediately.'
Upon which I looked through the keyhole of the door
and saw her eating; and when she had done eating
she stood still by the bedside as long as thanks might
be given, and then she made a courtesy (or bend) and
opened the chamber door, and gave me a piece of the
bread, which I did eat, and I think it was the most
delicious bread that ever I did eat, either before or
since.</p>

<p>"Another odd passage, which I must relate, was
this: One Lord's Day, my father with his family being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
at dinner in our hall, comes in one of our neighbours,
whose name was Francis Heathman, and asked where
Anne was. We told him she was in her chamber.
Upon this he goes into her chamber to see her, but, not
seeing her, he calls her. She not answering, he feels up
and down the chamber for her, but not finding her,
comes and tells us she was not in her chamber. As
soon as he had said this, she comes out of her chamber
to us, as we were sitting at table, and tells him she was
in her chamber and saw him and heard him call her,
and saw him feel up and down the chamber for her, and
had almost felt her, but he could not see her, although
she saw him, notwithstanding she was, at the same
time, at the table in her chamber, eating her dinner.</p>

<p>"One day these fairies gave my sister (the new wife
of Mr. Humphry Martyn) then about four years of age,
a silver cup, which held about a quart, bidding her give
it my mother, and she did bring it my mother; but my
mother would not accept of it, but bid her carry it to
them again; which she did. I presume this was the
time my sister owns she saw the fairies. I confess to
your lordship, I never did see them. I had almost
forgot to tell your lordship, that Anne would tell what
people would come to her, several days before they
came, and from whence, and at what time they would
come.</p>

<p>"I have seen Anne in the orchard, dancing among
the trees, and she told me she was then dancing with
the fairies.</p>

<p>"The great noise of the many strange cures Anne
did, and also her living without eating our victuals, she
being fed, as she said, by these fairies, caused both the
neighbouring magistrates and ministers to resort to my
father's house, and talk with her, and strictly examine
her about the matter here related; and she gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
very rational answers to all their questions they then
asked her; for by this time she was well recovered out
of her sickness and fits, and her natural parts and
understanding much improved, my father and all his
family affirming the truth of all she said.</p>

<p>"The ministers endeavouring to persuade her they
were evil spirits resorted to her, and that it was the
delusions of the devil. But how could that be when she
did no hurt, but good to all who came to her for cure of
their distempers? and advised her not to go to them
when they called her. However, that night after the
magistrates and ministers were gone, my father, with his
family, sitting at a great fire in the hall, Anne being
also present, she spake to my father and said, 'Now they
call!' meaning the fairies. We all of us urged her not
to go. In less than half a quarter of an hour she said,
'Now they call a second time!' We encouraged her
again not to go to them. By and by she said, 'Now
they call a third time!' Upon which, away to her
chamber she went to them. Of all these calls of the
fairies, none heard them but Anne. After she had been
in the chamber some time, she came to us again with
a Bible in her hand, and tells us that when she came to
the fairies, they said to her, 'What, hath there been
some magistrates and ministers to you, and dissuaded
you from coming any more to us, saying we are evil
spirits, and that it is all delusions of the devil? Pray
desire them to read in the 1st Epistle of S. John,
chapter 4, verse 1, "Dearly beloved, believe not every
spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God."'
This place of Scripture was turned down to in the said
Bible. I told your lordship before, Anne could not
read.</p>

<p>"After this, one John Tregeagle, Esq., who was
steward to John, Earl of Radnor, being then a Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
of Peace in Cornwall, sent his warrant for Anne, and
sent her to Bodmin jail, and there kept her a long time.
That day the constable came to execute his warrant,
Anne milking the cows, the fairies appeared to her and
told her that a constable would come that day with
a warrant to carry her before a justice of the peace, and
she would be sent to jail. She asked them if she
should hide herself. They answered, No, she should
fear nothing, but go with the constable. So she went
with the constable to the justice, and he sent her to
Bodmin jail and ordered the prison-keeper that she
should be kept without victuals; and she was so kept,
and yet she lived, and that without complaining.
When the sessions came, the justices of the peace sent
their warrant to one Giles Bawden, a neighbour of
ours, who was then a constable, for my mother and
myself to appear before them, at the sessions, to
answer such questions as should be demanded of us
about our poor maid Anne.</p>

<p>"Bodmin was eight miles from my father's. When
we came to the sessions, the first who was called in
before the justices was my mother. What questions
they asked her I do not remember. When they had
done examining her, they desired her to withdraw.
As soon as she came forth I was brought in, and called
to the upper end of the table to be examined, and there
was the clerk of the peace, with the pen ready in his
hand, to take my examination. The first question they
asked me was, 'What have you got in your pockets?'
I answered, 'Nothing, sir, but my cuffs': which I
immediately plucked out and I showed them. The
second question to me was, If I had any victuals in
my pockets for my maid Anne? I answered I had
not; and so they dismissed me, as well as my mother.
But poor Anne lay in jail for a considerable time after;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
and also Justice Tregeagle, who was her great persecutor,
kept her in his house some time as a prisoner,
and that without victuals. And at last when Anne was
discharged out of prison, the justice made an order
that Anne should not live any more with my father.
Whereupon my father's only sister, Mrs. Frances Tom,
a widow, near Padstow, took Anne into her family,
and there she lived a considerable time and did many
cures; but what they were, my kinsman, Mr. William
Tom, who there lived in the house with his mother,
can give your lordship the best account of any I know
living, except Anne herself. And from hence she went
to live with her own brother, and, in process of time,
married, etc.</p>

<p>"I am your lordship's most humble and dutiful
servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Moses Pitt</span>.</p>

<p>
"<i>May 1st, 1699.</i>"
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are several points to be considered in this
curious story. It is written in all good faith, and is
an honest account of what Pitt remembered of events
that took place some fifty years previously, when he
was a boy.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the first portion of the story that
cannot be explained without the intervention of fairies
or pixies; but it is not so easy to account for Anne's
abstaining wholly from the food of mortals like herself
and being sustained on fairy food. It is not uncommon
for women to pretend that they do not eat; there have
been many "fasting girls," but all have been shown
up to be impostors. In this case, however, Anne
Jefferies did not pretend to be a fasting girl, but to be
nourished by fairies. In the house of the Pitts she
might have surreptitiously procured food, but this she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
could not do in the jail at Bodmin, nor in the house
of Justice Tregeagle.</p>

<p>As to the cures she wrought, they are to be put in
the same category as faith cures all the world over,
whether performed at Lourdes, or by Christian scientists,
or by Shamans in the steppes of Tartary.</p>

<p>Moses Pitt, the writer of the letter, was the son of
John Pitt, yeoman, of S. Teath; he was bound apprentice
to Robert Litterbury, citizen and haberdasher, in
London, for seven years from October 1st, 1654. He
became a foreman of the Haberdashers' Company
8th November, 1661, and started as a publisher and
speculative builder. In 1680 he began to issue <i>The
English Atlas</i> at his shop "The Angel," in S. Paul's
Churchyard. It was to be in twelve volumes, and was
dedicated to the King, but was never completed, as he
got into difficulties. In the first place he became sole
executor to a Captain Richard Mill, who had tenant
right to the "Blue Boar's Head," in King Street, Westminster,
at an annual rent of £20. Pitt had to pay
this, and also Captain Mill's widow an annuity of £50.
But he found the "Blue Boar's Head" so dilapidated that
he had to rebuild it at a heavy outlay before he could
let it. Then he had a quarrel with a neighbour about
a party wall he was rebuilding, leading to law proceedings,
and Pitt was cast in costs and damages. But
his most serious loss was entailed by his building a
house for Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, which that judge
agreed to take at £300 per annum. As part of the
land on which it was to be built was Crown property,
Jeffreys guaranteed Pitt that he would obtain a lease
for ninety-nine years of it, and bade him hurry on the
building. When Pitt had spent £4000 on it, Jeffreys
was disgraced and fell, owing to the flight of James II
and the advent of William of Orange. Pitt, greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
embarrassed for money, fled to Ireland; he mortgaged
his estates for £3000, but as his creditors were not
satisfied, he was finally arrested and sent to the Fleet
Prison April 18th, 1689, where he remained till the
16th May, 1691, when he was transferred to the King's
Bench.</p>

<p>He published in the same year "The Cry of the
Oppressed, being a true and tragical account of the
unparallel'd suffering of multitudes of poor imprisoned
debtors in most of the gaols of England, under the
tyranny of the gaolers and other oppressors.... Together
with the case of the Publisher." The sufferings
of the debtors he knew by personal experience, and his
revelation is one of horrors perpetrated in the Fleet
and elsewhere, and illustrated with very graphic copper-plates.
His account of his own troubles occupies sixty-seven
pages, and shows him to have been a reckless
speculator. Having been educated as a haberdasher,
he undertook to be a publisher, and simultaneously to
be a builder.</p>

<p>He probably obtained his release before 1695, as in
that year he published a letter relative to some discourses
upon Dr. Burnet and Dr. Tillotson, by a parson
named George Hicker, <span class="smcap">d.d.</span>, and in 1696 he wrote the
account of Anne Jefferies, given above. He was married
to a Miss Upman. The date of his death is not known.
Justice Tregeagle, who was the special "persecutor" of
Anne Jefferies, is very well remembered in Cornish
legend. He was a particularly wicked man and harsh
steward, and lies buried near the chancel of S. Breock.
His home was Trevorder, in that parish.</p>

<h2>THOMAS KILLIGREW, THE
KING'S JESTER</h2>


<p>The Killigrew family seems to have possessed
a great hankering after the stage, for four of
them were playwrights. Indeed, Henry
Killigrew, educated at Christ Church, Oxford,
began at the age of seventeen, when a play written
by him was performed at the nuptials of Lord
Charles Herbert with Lady Mary Villiers, at the Black
Friars. Some critics present objected that one of the
characters, representing a boy of seventeen, talked too
freely for his age, and Falkland replied "that it was
neither monstrous nor impossible for one of seventeen
years to speak at such a rate; when he that made him
speak in that manner, and who wrote the whole play,
was himself no older."</p>

<p>Sir William Killigrew, Knt., who was loyal to
Charles I, and stood high in favour with Charles II,
usher of the privy chamber and vice-chamberlain to
the Queen, also wrote plays, tragi-comedies, but they
do not appear to have taken with the public.</p>

<p>But the man who was most stage-stricken of the family
was Thomas, the fourth son of Sir Robert Killigrew, born
in 1611. He became early in life page of honour to
Charles I, and he attended Charles II when in exile.
At this period, when Charles was sorely in need of
money, Thomas Killigrew was despatched as "Resident"
to Venice, in 1652, "to borrow money of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
merchants for his (Charles's) owne subsistence," and
"to press the Duke to furnish Us with a present some
(sum) of money and we will engage ourselves by any
Act or Acts to repay with interest, and so likewise for
any Arms or Ammunition he shall be pleased to furnish
Us withall. The summe you shall move him to furnish
Us with shall be Ten thousand Pistolls."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_656.png" id="i_656.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_656.png" alt="Thomas Killigrew" title="Thomas Killigrew" />
   <p class="caption2"><i>Thomas Killigrew Groome of y<sup>e</sup> Bedchamber to
King Charles y<sup>e</sup> Second</i></p>
</div>

<p>According to Hyde, Charles misdoubted the suitableness
of Killigrew for this delicate negotiation; and
was finally prevailed to send him, simply to gratify
Tom.</p>

<p>The misgivings of the Prince were justified, for
Killigrew and his servants behaved so badly at Venice
that the Doge, Francisco Erizzo, had to complain
through his ambassador.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hyde, in a letter to Sir Richard Browne,
wrote: "I have informed the Kinge of the Venetian
Ambassador's complainte against Mr. Killigrew, with
which His Majesty is very much troubled, and resolves
upon his returne hither to examyne his miscarriage,
and to proceed therein in such a manner as shall be
worthy of him, and as may manifest his respecte to
that Commonwealth, with which the Crowne of
Englande hath alwayes held a very stricte amity, and
His Majesty's Ministers have in all places preserved a
very good correspondence with the Ministers of that
State, and therefore His Majesty is more sensible of
this misdemeanour of his Resident."</p>

<p>On Killigrew's return to the Court of S. Germain,
Sir John Denham addressed him in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Our Resident Tom<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From Venice has come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has left the Statesman behind him;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Talks at the same pitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is as wise, is as rich,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And just where you left him, you find him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">But who says he is not<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A man of much plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May repent of this false accusation;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Having-plotted and penn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Six plays to attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Farce of his negotiation.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But although Charles might put on an appearance of
being indignant, and though he was vexed that Tom
did not return laden with "pistolls," he was too careless
and too fond of being entertained to part with his
principal buffoon. But thenceforth he employed him
mainly in transactions about wine, canary and sack, of
which the Prince needed much.</p>

<p>The story is told of Louis XIV that he had heard
much of the wit of Tom Killigrew, and sent for him to
Versailles, where he talked to him, but could elicit
nothing from him. Thinking that this proceeded from
shyness he drew him apart, and led him into the
gallery to show him the pictures. There he asked him
if he knew what they represented. Tom expressed his
ignorance, whereupon the King led him before a painting
of the Crucifixion, and asked him what that represented.
"I believe, your Majesty," replied Tom,
"that it is a picture of Christ between two thieves."</p>

<p>"And who might they be?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty and the Pope," replied the audacious
jester.</p>

<p>The first wife of Thomas Killigrew was Cecilia, a
daughter of Sir John Crofts, of Saxham, in Suffolk,
and he was married to her on June 29th, 1636.</p>

<p>The weather on the wedding day was rude and
boisterous, which gave rise to some lines by Thomas
Carew:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such should this day be; so the sun should hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bashful face, and let the conquering bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a rivall shine, whilst he forbears<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>

<span class="i0">In vayles, but as a masquer to the feast."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She brought her husband a fortune of £10,000, and a
son and heir, Henry, born in April, 1637. She was
buried the 5th January, 1638, in Westminster Abbey.
Tom married again, when in exile, at the Hague, and
his second wife was Charlotte, daughter of John van
Hesse, a Dutch woman. The marriage took place
26th January, 1655, and by her he had three sons,
Robert, Charles, and Thomas.</p>

<p>At length came the recall of Charles to England,
and Tom Killigrew accompanied him in the same
vessel, very lighthearted, and expectant of great
things. Pepys had gone over to meet the King, and
he says, May 24th, 1660: "Walking upon the decks,
were persons of honour all the afternoon, among others
Thomas Killigrew, a merry droll, but a gentleman of
great esteem with the King, who told us many merry
stories." Among them one Pepys quotes, which is
profane.</p>

<p>Thomas Killigrew was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber,
with a salary of £400 per annum, which he
augmented by receiving bribes from those who were
solicitous to obtain posts under the Crown, and to use
his influence with the King to get them.</p>

<p>He had now an opportunity of producing on the
London stage the plays that he had composed whilst
abroad. Of these there were eight, comedies and tragi-comedies,
all borrowed, none exhibiting any genuine
wit, but steeped in ordure. One, <i>The Parson's Wedding</i>,
borrowed from <i>The Antiquary</i>, by Shakerly
Marmion, and <i>Raw Alley</i>, by Lord Barrey, was actually
to be performed wholly by women. It has been well said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
by Mr. Tregellas: "We find ourselves indeed 'surrounded
by foreheads of bronze, hearts like the nether
millstone, and tongues set on fire of hell.' I must add
that they have scarcely a sparkle of that witty wickedness
which one meets with in the writings of Sir Charles
Sedley."</p>

<p>All Killigrew's plays were printed in folio in 1644.
Pepys did not see much merit in them. Of <i>The Parson's
Wedding</i> he says: "Luellin tells me what an obscene,
loose play this is, that is acted by nothing but women,
at the King's House." Of <i>Claracilla</i>, "a poor play."
Of <i>Love at First Sight</i>, "I find the play to be a poor
thing, and so I perceive every body else do." Nor did
he think much of Killigrew's conversation. He described
it as "poor and frothy."</p>

<p>In <i>The Companion to the Playhouse</i>, 1764, there are
some stories told of Killigrew.</p>

<p>"After the Restoration he continued in high favour
with the King, and had frequently access to him when
he was denied to the first peers of the realm; and being
a man of great wit and liveliness of parts, and having
from his long intimacy with that monarch, and being
continually about his person during his troubles,
acquired a freedom of familiarity with him, which
even the pomp of Majesty afterwards could not check
in him, he sometimes, by way of jest, which King
Charles was ever fond of, if genuine, even tho' himself
was the object of the satire, would adventure bold
truths which scarcely any one beside would have dared
even to hint to. One story in particular is related of
him, which, if true, is a strong proof of the great
lengths he would sometimes proceed in his freedoms of
this kind, which is as follows: When the King's unbounded
passion for women had given his mistress
such an ascendancy over him, that, like the effeminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
Persian monarch, he was fitter to have handled a distaff
than to wield a sceptre, and for the conversation of
his concubines utterly neglected the most important
affairs of state, Mr. Killigrew went to pay his Majesty
a visit in his private apartments, habited like a pilgrim
who was bent on a long journey. The King,
surprised at the oddity of his appearance, immediately
asked him what was the meaning of it, and whither
he was going. '<i>To Hell</i>,' bluntly replied the man.
'Prithee,' said the King, 'what can your errand be to
that place?' 'To fetch back Oliver Cromwell,' rejoined
he, 'that he may take some care of the affairs
of England, for his successor takes none at all.'"</p>

<p>This was not the only time that Killigrew gave good
counsel to the King. Pepys says: "Mr. Pierce did
tell me as a great truth, as being told by Mr. Cowley,
who was by, and heard it, that Tom Killigrew should
publicly tell the King that his matters were coming
into a very ill state, and that yet there was a way to
help all. Says he: 'There is a good, honest, able
man, that I could name, that, if your Majesty would
employ, and command to see all things well executed,
all things would soon be mended; and this one is
Charles Stuart, who now spends his time in employing
his lips about the Court, and hath no other employment,
but if you would give him this employment, he
were the fittest man in the world to perform it.' This,
he says, is most true; but the King do not profit by
any of this, but lays it aside, and remembers nothing,
but to his pleasures again."</p>

<p>On another occasion Killigrew is said to have placed
under the candlestick where Charles II supped, five
small papers, on each of which he had written the
word <span class="smcap">all</span>. The King on seeing them, asked what he
meant by these five words. "If your Majesty will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
grant my pardon, I will tell you," was his reply. Pardon
being promised, Killigrew said: "The first <span class="smcap">ALL</span>
signified that the country had sent all it could to the
exchequer; the second, that the City had lent all it
could and would; the third, that the Court had spent
all; the fourth, that if we did not mend all; the fifth
would be the worse for all."</p>

<p>This was afterwards adapted and turned upon the
family of William of Orange: "That he was William
Think-all; his queen Mary Take-all; Prince George
of Denmark, George Drink-all; and Princess Anne,
Anne Eat-all."</p>

<p>Although Thomas Killigrew went by the designation
of the King's Jester, he held no official position
as such.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooling told us how the King, once speaking
of the Duke of York's being mastered by his wife, said
to some of the company, by that he would go no more
abroad with this Tom Otter (a hen-pecked husband in
Ben Jonson's <i>Epicæne</i>), meaning the Duke of York
and his wife. Tom Killigrew, being by, said, 'Sir,
pray which is the best, for a man to be a Tom Otter to
his wife or to his mistress?' meaning the King's
being so to my Lady Castlemaine."</p>

<p>Killigrew was engaged one morning with one of his
own plays, which he took up in the window, whilst His
Majesty was shaving. "Ah, Killigrew," asked the
King, "what will you say at the Last Day in defence
of the idle words in that book?" To which Tom replied,
that he could give a better account of his "idle
words," than the King would be able to give respecting
his "idle promises and more idle patents, that had
undone more than ever did his books."</p>

<p>"One more story is related of him, which is not
barren of humour. King Charles's fondness for pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
to which he almost always made business give way,
used frequently to delay affairs of consequence, from
His Majesty's disappointing the Council of his presence
when met for dispatch of business, which neglect gave
great disgust and offence to many of those who were
treated with this seeming disrespect. On one of these
occasions the Duke of Lauderdale, who was naturally
impetuous and turbulent, quitted the council-chamber
in a violent passion, and, meeting Mr. Killigrew
presently after, expressed himself on the occasion in
very disrespectful terms of His Majesty. Killigrew
begged His Grace to moderate his passion, and offered
to lay him a wager of a hundred pounds that he himself
would prevail on His Majesty to come to the
council within half an hour. The Duke, surprised at
the boldness of the assertion, and warmed by his resentment
against the King, accepted the wager, on
which Killigrew immediately went to the King, and
without ceremony told him what had happened, adding
these words: 'I knew that Your Majesty hated Lauderdale,
though the necessity of your affairs compels you
to carry an outward appearance of civility; now, if
you choose to be rid of a man who is thus disagreeable
to you, you need only go this once to council, for
I know his covetous disposition so perfectly, that I am
well persuaded, rather than pay this hundred pounds,
he would hang himself out of the way, and never
plague you more.'</p>

<p>"The King was so pleased with the archness of the
observation, that he immediately replied, 'Well, then,
Killigrew, I positively will go.' And kept his word
accordingly."</p>

<p>Pepys has a good deal to say about Killigrew. He
tells how Killigrew became enamoured of the stage
when a boy. "He would go to the 'Red Bull,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
when the man cried to the boys, 'Who will go and be
a devil, and he shall see the play for nothing?' then
would he go in, and be a devil upon the stage, and so
get to see plays."</p>

<p>2nd August, 1664. "To the King's playhouse, and
there saw <i>Bartholomew Fayre</i>, which do still please me,
and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world,
I believe. I chanced to sit by Tom Killigrew, who
tells me that he is setting up a nursery (for actors), that
is, is going to build a house in Moorefields, wherein he
will have common plays acted."</p>

<p>12th February, 1666-7. "With my Lord Bronnaker
by coach to his house, there to hear some Italian
musique, and there we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Robert
Murray, and the Italian, Signor Baptista, who hath
proposed a play in Italian for the Opera, which T.
Killigrew do intend to have up."</p>

<p>Thomas Killigrew was nearly sixty years old when
he narrowly escaped assassination in S. James's Park.
He had been carrying on an intrigue with Lady Shrewsbury,
but found a dangerous and more successful rival
in the Duke of Buckingham. Whereupon in spite
and revenge he poured over the lady a stream of foul
and venomous satire. The result was that one evening,
on his return from the Duke of York's, some
ruffians, hired for the purpose, set upon Tom's chair,
through which they passed their swords three times,
wounding him in the arm. The assassins then fled,
having killed his man, and believing they had killed
Tom Killigrew.</p>

<p>He recovered from his wound, lived on thirteen or
fourteen years longer, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey on 19th March, 1682-3.</p>

<p>His son Thomas was a playwright, and his son
Charles proprietor of "the Playhouse, Drury Lane."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>

<p>The Killigrews have now passed, not individually
only, but as a family off the stage of life, and are remembered
only by their deeds, good and bad, as recorded
in history. It was usually said of Tom Killigrew
that when he attempted to write he was dull, whereas
in conversation he was smart; and this was precisely
the reverse of Cowley, who did not shine in conversation,
but sparkled with his pen. In allusion to this
Denham wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had Cowley ne'er spoken, and Killigrew ne'er writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combin'd in one, they'd make a matchless wit.<br /></span>

<h2>NICOLAS ROSCARROCK</h2>


<p>Nicolas Roscarrock was the fifth son
of Richard Roscarrock, of Roscarrock, in
S. Endelion, by Isabell, daughter of Richard
Trevenor. His grandmother was a Boscawen.
His father during his lifetime had settled upon
him the estates of Penhall, Carbura, and Newtown,
in the parishes of S. Cleer and S. Germans.</p>

<p>He first studied at Exeter College, Oxford, and took
his B.A. in 1568. Carew, in his <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>,
p. 299, tells us of "his industrious delight in matters
of history and antiquity."</p>

<p>In 1577 Roscarrock was admitted student of the
Inner Temple. In the same year was published by
Richard Tottell <i>The Worthies of Armorie ... collected
and gathered by John Bossewell</i>, to which were
prefixed ninety-four verses, entitled <i>Cilenus, Censur
of the Author of his High Court of Herehautry</i>, by
Nicolas Roscarrocke.</p>

<p>In the Inner Temple he seems to have been associated
with Raleigh, for in 1576 appeared <i>The Steepleglas,
a satyre</i>, and among commendatory verses are
some signed "N. R." and the rest by "Walter Rawely
of the Inner Temple."</p>

<p>In 1577 he was in Cornwall, where he suffered much
annoyance because of his faith, as he refused to conform
to the English liturgy, and maintained the Papal
supremacy. It was in 1570 that Pope Pius V had
issued a bull of excommunication against Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
deprived her of her title to the crown, and absolved
her subjects from their oaths of allegiance. This
violent and ill-judged proceeding at once converted all
those who held by the Pope into suspected traitors;
and measures were adopted against them, the more so
as the Jesuits and their agents were more than suspected
of forming plots for the assassination of the Queen.</p>

<p>Nicolas Roscarrock was accused at Launceston
Assizes on September 16th, 1577, "for not going to
church." He was in London later, and was an active
member of the "Young Men's Club," 1579-81.</p>

<p>From the <i>State Papers</i>, 1547-50, we learn that two
spies were employed by the Government to discover
Nicolas Roscarrock. He had, however, probably fled
to Douay, where a Roscarrock is entered in the <i>Douay
Diary</i> as landing on September, 1580.</p>

<p>But he was again in England in 1581, when he was
sent to the Tower, where by a refinement of cruelty he
was placed in a cell adjoining that of a friend who had
been racked, that the moans of the latter might intimidate
Roscarrock into giving evidence of plots against
the life of the Queen. On January 14th, 1581, Nicolas
was himself tortured on the rack. He remained for
five years in prison in the Tower, and in the Fleet
again till 1594, in all fourteen years.</p>

<p>He was finally released, and went in 1607 north to
Naworth to Lord William Howard, with whom he remained
till his death, which took place in 1633 or 1634,
when he had reached an advanced age.</p>

<p>Such in brief is the history of Nicolas Roscarrock.</p>

<p>Whilst he was at Naworth, he occupied himself in
compiling a volume of the <i>Lives of the English Saints</i>.</p>

<p>The first part he wrote with his own hand, but as his
sight failed, he was obliged to employ an amanuensis,
who wrote very untidily and made strange havoc of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
many of the names, which he wrote phonetically from
dictation. The MS. has undergone annotation by two
hands: one was Roscarrock himself, who added in
matters which reached him later; the other was Dom
Gregory Hungate, a Benedictine.</p>

<p>As far as can be judged, the MS. was compiled between
1610 and 1625.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>After the dispersion of Lord William Howard's
library, we do not know what became of the book till
about 1700, when it formed a portion of a library bequeathed
to Brent Eleigh parish, in Suffolk, by a certain
Mr. Edward Colman, sometime of Trinity College,
Cambridge. Here it seems to have undergone rough
usage, and it was probably there that the MS. lost so
many pages torn out. As it is, it consists of no fewer
than 850 pages; folio 253 is missing, also some pages
from the beginning and something like ninety at the
end that have been torn out.</p>

<p>At the sale of the Brent Eleigh Library, the MS.
was purchased by the University Library managers,
Cambridge, and it is now in that library (Add. MS.
3041).</p>

<p>It is a thick volume, measuring 1 ft. by 8&frac14; in.</p>

<p>It possesses an Introduction, "How Saynts may be
esteemed soe, Secondlye of their Commemorations and
the trewest enfalliblest manner of discovering them,
and what Course the Collector of this Alphebitt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
Saints that he observed in this Collection." Then
follows an article on the Canonizing of Saints, and
another "Of the Course and Order which is to be
observed in my Collection." Then ensues a Calendar,
and this is followed by an alphabetical biographical
notice of the saints to Simon Sudbury, where the rest
is torn away.</p>

<p>Nicolas Roscarrock had recourse mainly to printed
authorities, to Capgrave, Surius, Harpsfield, and to
Whytford's <i>Martyrologie</i>. But he had also access to
the MSS. of Edward Powell, a Welsh priest, who had
a considerable collection of Welsh saintly pedigrees.
With regard to the Cornish saints, he records current
traditions of his time, that he had collected in his
youth. But he had also a MS. Cornish life of
S. Columba, to which Hals refers. Unhappily, he
has not given us the original, only its substance. And
he quotes from a Cornish hymn or ballad relative to
S. Mabenna, but which to our great regret he does not
give. Here and there he indulges in verses of his own
composition in honour of the saints, but they are of
no poetic merit.</p>

<p>In the volume is a letter undated, addressed by one
W. Webbe to&mdash;we suppose&mdash;the chaplain at Naworth.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Most Worthy Syr,</p>

<p>"Mr. Trewenna Roscarrock found in the library
of Oxford a story of a certain Christian and his wife
who came out of Ireland with their children to fly the
persecution, and lived in Cornwall: and after some
tyme both he and his wife with the children suffered
martyrdom in Cornwall, and in their honour were faire
Churches dedicated. Some of the names of these
saints (as wee suppose) wear these as follow:&mdash;</p>

Mr. Roscarrock's Book, and keeping noe coppy of it
lent it to his brother, Mr. Nicolas Roscarocke, who

y<sup>e</sup> North.</p>

<p>"Now some worthye Catholickes of Cornwall being

they knowing that he was wont to compile together
such monuments for further memorye. I did soe and

<h2>LIEUTENANT PHILIP G. KING</h2>


<p>The Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy,
near the close of 1786, advertised for a
certain number of vessels to be taken up for
the purpose of conveying between seven
and eight hundred male and female convicts to Botany
Bay, in New South Wales, whither it had been determined
by the Government to transport them, after
having sought in vain upon the African coast for a
situation possessing the requisites for the establishment
of a penal colony. The following vessels were
at length contracted for, and assembled in the Thames
to fit and take in stores: the <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Scarborough</i>,
<i>Charlotte</i>, <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, and <i>Friendship</i> as transports;
and the <i>Fishbourne</i>, <i>Golden Grove</i>, and <i>Borrowdale</i>&mdash;these
latter as storeships. The <i>Prince of Wales</i>
was afterwards added to the number of transports.
The transports immediately prepared for the reception
of the convicts, and the storeships took on board
provisions for two years, with tools, implements of
agriculture, seeds, etc.</p>

<p>On October 24th Captain Arthur Phillips hoisted a
pennant on board H.M.S. <i>Sirius</i>, of twenty guns, then
lying at Deptford. As the government of the meditated
colony, as well as the command of the <i>Sirius</i>, was
given to Captain Phillips, it was thought necessary to
appoint another captain to her, who might command
on any service in which she might be employed for
the colony, while Captain Phillips would be engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
supervising the convicts on shore. For this purpose
John Hunter was nominated second captain of the
<i>Sirius</i>.</p>

<p>On March 5th, 1787, order for embarkation arrived,
and on Monday, May 7th, Captain Phillips arrived at
Portsmouth and took command of the little fleet, then
lying at the Mother Bank.</p>

<p>Phillips had with him two lieutenants, Philip Gidley
King and Mr. Dawes.</p>

<p>Philip G. King was the son of Philip King, a draper
in Launceston, by his wife, the daughter of John
Gidley, attorney, of Exeter. Philip G. King was born
at Launceston 23rd April, 1758. He was midshipman
on board the <i>Swallow</i> in 1770-5, and now was placed
under Captain Phillips to assist in the settlement of
felons in a colony at Botany Bay.</p>

<p>Whilst the little fleet was on its way down the Channel,
it was discovered that a plot had been formed
among the convicts on board the <i>Scarborough</i> to mutiny.
They hoped to obtain command of the vessel, when
those in the other transports would follow their example,
and they trusted that the entire fleet would fall
into their power. The scheme was insane, as H.M.S.
<i>Sirius</i> could knock the transports to pieces with her
guns. The plot was betrayed by one of the convicts
to the commanding officer on board the <i>Scarborough</i>,
and he at once communicated with Captain Phillips.
The two ringleaders were brought on board the <i>Sirius</i>,
and each was given two dozen lashes.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed for Teneriffe, and thence, on the 11th
June, for Rio de Janeiro; and from thence for the Cape
of Good Hope.</p>

<p>On November 10th, Captain Phillips sailed ahead of
the fleet in the <i>Supply</i> to reconnoitre the coast of New
South Wales, and ascertain where best to land, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
took with him the <i>Alexander</i>, the <i>Scarborough</i>, and the
<i>Friendship</i>, and having on board his two lieutenants,
King and Dawes.</p>

   <p class="caption2">LIEUTENANT PHILIP GIDLEY KING</p>
</div>

<p>On January 19th, 1788, he landed in Botany Bay,
and sent Lieutenant King to survey the coast and
inland as far as might be.</p>

<p>Botany Bay being found to be a station of inferior
advantages to what was expected, and no spot appearing
proper for the colony, Governor Phillips at once
resolved to transfer it to another excellent inlet, about
twelve miles further to the north, called Port Jackson,
on the south side of which, at a spot called Sydney
Cove, the settlement was decided to be made.</p>

<p>The spot chosen for this purpose was at the head of
the cove, near a run of fresh water, which stole silently
along through a very thick wood, the stillness of which
had thus, for the first time since the Creation, been
interrupted by the rude sound of the labourer's axe
and the downfall of the ancient inhabitants&mdash;a stillness
and tranquillity which from that day were to give place
to the noise of labour, the confusion of carriers, and
all the clamour of the bringing on shore of the stores,
and the erection of habitations.</p>

<p>A flagstaff was set up and the Union Jack hoisted,
when the Marines fired several volleys, and the healths
of the King and Royal Family were drunk, as well as
success to the new colony.</p>

<p>The disembarkation of the troops and convicts took
place on the following day.</p>

<p>The confusion that ensued will not be wondered at
when it is considered that every man stepped from his
boat literally into a virgin forest. Parties of people
were to be seen on all sides variously employed, some
in clearing ground for the different encampments,
others in pitching tents, or bringing up such stores as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
were more immediately needed. As the woods were
opened and the ground cleared, the various encampments
were extended, and all gradually assumed the
appearance of regularity.</p>

<p>A portable canvas house, brought over for the
governor, was erected on the south side of the cove,
which was named Sydney, in compliment to the principal
Secretary of State for the Home Department.
There also a small body of convicts was put under
tents. The detachment of marines was encamped at
the head of the cove near the stream, and on the west
side was planted the main body of convicts.</p>

<p>The women were not disembarked till the 6th February,
when, every person belonging to the settlement
being landed, the whole amounted to 1030 persons.
The tents for the sick were placed on the west side, and
it was observed with concern that their number was
fast increasing. Scurvy, that had not appeared during
the voyage, now broke out, and this, along with
dysentery, began to fill the hospital, and several died.</p>

<p>In addition to the medicines that were administered,
every species of esculent plant that could be found in
the country was procured for them&mdash;wild celery,
spinach, and parsley fortunately grew in abundance.
Those who were in health, as well as the sick, were
glad to introduce this wholesome addition to their
ration of salt meat.</p>

<p>The public stock, consisting of one bull, four cows,
one bull-calf, one stallion, three mares, and three colts,
were landed and left to crop the pasturage of the little
farm that had been formed at the head of an adjoining
cove, and which had been placed under the direction of
a man brought out for the purpose by the Governor.</p>

<p>Some ground having been dug over and prepared
near His Excellency's house on the south side, the plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
brought from Rio de Janeiro and from the Cape were
planted, and the colonists soon had the satisfaction of
seeing the grapes, figs, oranges, pears, and apples&mdash;in
a word, the best fruits of the Old World&mdash;taking root
and establishing themselves in this their New World.</p>

<p>As soon as the hurry and turmoil of disembarkation
had subsided, the Governor caused His Majesty's
commission appointing him to be Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales and its dependencies,
to be publicly read, and he then addressed
the convicts, assuring them that "he would be ever
ready to show approbation and encouragement to those
who proved themselves worthy of them by good conduct
and attention to orders; while, on the other hand,
such as were determined to act in opposition to propriety,
and observe a contrary conduct, would inevitably
meet with the punishment they deserved."</p>

<p>The convicts from the first gave much trouble. They
secreted the tools, so as to avoid being compelled to
work, and it was found almost impossible to get work
out of them, as there was a deficiency of proper men to
set over them. Those who were so placed were for
the most part also convicts, men who by their conduct
during the voyage had recommended themselves,
and these had been appointed foremen over the
rest, but it was soon discovered that they lacked the
authority requisite. The sailors from the transports,
though repeatedly forbidden to do so and frequently
punished, persisted in bringing spirits on shore every
night, and drunkenness was often the consequence.</p>

<p>Before the month of February was half through,
a plot among the convicts to rob the store was discovered.
This was the more unpardonable in that the
rations given out to the convicts were precisely the same
as those served to the soldiers. Each male convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
received as his weekly portion 7 lb. biscuits, 1 lb. flour,
7 lb. beef, 4 lb. pork, 3 pints of peas, 6 oz. of butter;
the women received one-third less.</p>

<p>The ringleaders were charged before a Court that
was summoned. One was hanged, another reprieved on
condition of becoming the public executioner; the rest
had milder sentences.</p>

<p>The Governor having received instructions to establish
another settlement on Norfolk Island, the <i>Supply</i>
sailed for that place in the midst of February under the
command of Lieutenant King of the <i>Sirius</i>, named by
Captain Phillips superintendent and commandant of
the settlement to be formed there. Lieutenant King
took with him one surgeon, one petty officer, two
private soldiers, two persons who pretended to have
some knowledge of flax-dressing, and nine male and
six female convicts. This little party was to be landed
with tents, clothing, implements of husbandry, tools for
dressing flax, etc., and provisions for six months, before
the expiration of which time it was intended to send
them a fresh supply.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island was to be settled with a view to the
cultivation of flax, which at the time when the island
was discovered by Captain Cook was found growing
most luxuriantly where he had landed; this was the
<i>Phormi tenax</i>, New Zealand flax.</p>

<p>Mr. King, previous to his departure for the new
settlement, was sworn in as a Justice of Peace, and was
empowered to punish such petty offences as might be
committed among the settlers; capital crime being
reserved for the cognizance of the Criminal Court
of Judicature, established at Sydney by Governor
Phillips.</p>

<p>The <i>Supply</i> reached Norfolk Island on February 29th,
but for five succeeding days was not able to effect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
landing, being prevented by a surf that was breaking
with violence on a reef that lay across the principal
bay. Lieutenant King had nearly given up all hopes
of being able to land, when a small opening was discovered
in the reef wide enough to admit a boat.
Through this he succeeded in passing safely, along
with his people and stores. When landed, he could
nowhere find a space clear for pitching a tent, and he
had to cut through an almost impenetrable jungle before
he could encamp himself and his people.</p>

<p>Of the stock he carried with him, he lost the only
she-goat he had, and one ewe. He had named the
bay wherein he landed and planted his settlement,
Sydney; and had given the names of Phillip and
Nepean to two small islands situated at a small
distance from it.</p>

<p>The soil of Norfolk Island was ascertained to be very
rich, but Sydney Bay was exposed to the southerly
winds, which drove the surf furiously over the reef.
The <i>Supply</i> lost one of her hands, who was drowned
in attempting to pass through the reef. There was a
small bay on the further side of the island, but it was at
a considerable distance from the settlement.</p>

<p>On February 14th, 1789, Lieutenant Ball sailed for
Norfolk Island in the <i>Golden Grove</i> with provisions and
convicts, twenty-one male, six female convicts, and
three children; of the latter two were to be placed
under Lieutenant King's special care. They were of
different sexes; the boy, Parkinson, was about three
years of age, and had lost his mother on the voyage to
Botany Bay; the girl was a year older and had a
mother in the colony, but as she was a woman of
abandoned character, the child was taken from her, to
save it from the ruin which otherwise would inevitably
have befallen it. These children were to be instructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
in reading, writing, and husbandry. The Commandant
was directed to cause five acres of ground to be
allotted and cultivated for their benefit.</p>

<p>In March, the little colony in Norfolk Island was
threatened with an insurrection. The convicts plotted
the capture of the island and the seizure of Mr. King's
person. They had chosen the day when this was to be
effected, the first Saturday after the arrival of any ship
in the bay, except the <i>Sirius</i>. They had selected this
day, as it had for some time been Mr. King's custom
on Saturdays to visit a farm he had established at
a little distance from the settlement, and the military
generally chose that day for bringing in the cabbage-palm
from the woods. Mr. King was to be secured on
his way to the farm. A message, in the Commandant's
name, was to be sent to Mr. Jamison, the surgeon, who
was to be seized as soon as he got into the woods; and
the sergeant and the party of soldiers were to be treated
in the same manner. These being all properly disposed
of, a signal was to be made to the ship in the
bay to send her boat on shore, the crew of which were
to be made prisoners on landing; and two or three of
the insurgents were to go off in a boat belonging to
the island, and inform the commanding officer that the
ship's boat had been stove on the beach, and that the
Commandant, King, requested that another might be sent
on shore. This also was to be captured; and then, as
the last act in this plot, the ship was to be taken, in
which they designed to proceed to Otaheite, and there
establish a colony.</p>

<p>The plot was revealed to a seaman of the <i>Sirius</i>, who
lived with Mr. King as a gardener, by a female convict
who cohabited with him. On being acquainted with
the circumstances, the Commandant took such measures
as appeared to him necessary to defeat the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
the plotters; and several who were concerned in the
scheme were arrested and confessed the share they were
to have had in the execution of it.</p>

<p>Mr. King had hitherto, from the peculiarity of his
situation&mdash;secluded from society, and confined to a
small speck in the vast ocean, with but a handful of
people&mdash;drawn them around him, and had treated them
in a kindly and even confidential and affectionate
manner; but now he saw that these felons were too
ingrained with vice to appreciate such treatment, and
one of his first steps was to clear the ground as far as
was possible round the settlement, that future villainy
might not find a shelter in the woods. To this truly
providential circumstance many of the colonists were
afterwards indebted for their lives in an outbreak that
took place after he had quitted the island.</p>

<p>At this time there were on the island 16 free people,
51 male and 23 female convicts, and 4 children.</p>

<p>In June, 1789, Lieutenant Creswell was sent with 14
privates of the Marines to Norfolk Island, and with a
written order from His Excellency requiring Creswell
to take upon himself the direction and execution of
the authority invested in Lieutenant King, in the event
of any accident happening to the latter.</p>

<p>In March, 1790, 116 male and 68 female convicts
were sent to Norfolk Island and 27 children. Major
Ross was appointed to supersede King; both the
<i>Sirius</i> and the <i>Supply</i> arrived, but unhappily the former
ran upon the reef on the 19th April. All the officers
and people were saved, being dragged on shore through
the surf on a grating.</p>

<p>King returned to New South Wales in the <i>Supply</i>.
There had been disaster and distress in the colony
there. The sheep had been stolen and the cattle lost
in the woods, and these were not found till 1795, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
they had been lost for seven years, and they were then
found grazing on a remote clearing, and had increased
to a surprising degree.</p>

<p>It was now determined that Lieutenant King should
return to England and report progress. A Dutch
vessel was hired to take him and the officers and men
of the <i>Sirius</i> home. He sailed in the <i>Batavia</i> in April,
1790, and arrived in England December 20th, 1790.</p>

<p>Philip Gidley King was appointed Governor of New
South Wales, September, 1800, and held that appointment
till 15th August, 1806, when his health failing
he returned to England, and died at Lower Tooting,
Surrey, 3rd September, 1808.</p>

<p>He was the father of Rear-Admiral Philip Parker
King, who was born on Norfolk Island, 13th December,
1791, after his father had left for England. He entered
the Royal Navy as first-class volunteer in 1807, midshipman
in 1809, lieutenant in 1814. He married
Harriet, daughter of Christopher Lethbridge, of
Launceston, and died at Sydney 25th February, 1856,
and was buried at Parramatta beside his mother, who
had been laid there many years before, not having
come to England. There is no record as to who and
what she was.</p>

Diary may be consulted in John Hunter's <i>Historical
Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk
Island</i>, 1795; see also David Collins's <i>Account of the
English Colony of New South Wales</i>, 1798-1802.</p>

<h2>HICKS OF BODMIN</h2>


<p>William Robert Hicks was born at
Bodmin on 1st April, 1808&mdash;not to be an
April fool himself, but to be a right merry
jester, and not infrequently to make fools
of others. He was the son of a schoolmaster, and he,
Sir William Molesworth, of Pencarrow, and Colonel
Hamley were educated together for a while in the
school of his father.</p>

<p>William Robert became Clerk of the Board of
Guardians, Clerk of the Highway Board, and Governor
of the County Lunatic Asylum. He was a man
of many parts, a good mathematician, a clear-headed
and cool man of business, a musician, who could play
on the violin and play it well. But he was noted above
everything else as a humorist.</p>

<p>He was a short man and inordinately stout, weighing
sixteen stone. He had a broad, flexible, somewhat
flabby face, with a pair of twinkling grey eyes, a
short nose, somewhat protruding thick under lip, and
double chin that was very pronounced, and whiskers.
What was noticeable in Hicks's face was its flexibility.
He possessed the art and the power to tell his story
with his countenance as with his voice. Indeed, the
alterations of mood in his face were like a musical
accompaniment to a song. He was thought the best
story-teller of his day; was known as such in Cornwall
and Devon, but was not so well appreciated in
London, where the peculiar dry humour of the West,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
as well as the dialect, did not appeal to ordinary hearers
as they do in the two Western Counties. One of his
many Cornish friends once took Hicks up to town and
dined him at his club, thinking that he would keep the
table in a roar. But it was not so. His stories fell
somewhat flat, and that damped his spirits and he subsided.</p>

<p>One of Hicks's earliest and best friends was George
Wightwick, the architect, born at Mold in Flintshire
in 1802, who set up as architect in Plymouth in 1829,
and was employed to build additions to Bodmin
Gaol in 1842 and 1847. He was author of <i>The
Palace of Architecture</i>, published in 1840. And though
he was an excellent <i>raconteur</i>, second only to Hicks, he
was a most egregiously bad architect. Yet, strangely
enough, Mr. Wightwick supposed himself to be enlightened
in the matter of Gothic architecture, and in
1835 published in <i>Loudon's Architectural Magazine</i> "A
few observations on reviving taste for pointed Architecture,
with an illustrated description of a chapel just
erected at Bude Haven under the direction of the
author."</p>

<p>Wightwick it was who had the merit of discovering
Hicks and of introducing him to notables in Devon
and Cornwall, for, miserable architect though he was,
he had got the ear of the public in the West as a man
of charming manners and teeming with anecdote.
Through him Hicks obtained access into many a
country house, where they would sing, accompanying
themselves on the violin, and tell stories.</p>

<p>Hicks was made Governor of Bodmin Asylum in
1848, and found the old barbarous system of treatment
of the insane in full swing. He at once adopted gentle
methods and in a short while radically changed the
entire mode of treatment, with markedly good results.</p>

   <p class="caption2">WILLIAM R. HICKS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>One poor fellow, whom he found chained in a dark
cell on a bed of straw as a dangerous lunatic, he nearly
cured by kindly treatment. As the fellow showed
indications of great shrewdness and wit, Hicks released
him and made much of him. A gentleman on a visit
to the asylum once said to the lunatic, "I hear, man,
that you are Hicks's fool."</p>

<p>"Aw," replied he; "I zee you do your awn business
in that line."</p>

<p>He was once asked, "Whither does this path go, my
man?" He answered readily, "Zure I cannot tell 'ee.
I've knawed un bide here these last twenty year."</p>

<p>He was sitting on the high wall of the asylum that
commanded the road for some distance, with a turnpike
at the bottom of the hill. The company of a circus
passed by, with the various horses. As the manager
rode past, the lunatic said to him, "'Ow much might
'ee pay turnpike for they there spekkady hosses?"
"Oh," said the manager, "the same as for the others."
"Do 'ee now?" said the man on the wall. "Well to be
zure; my vather 'ad a spekkady hoss that never paid no
turnpike. They there sparky (speckled) hosses don't
pay no turnpikes here."</p>

<p>"Bless my life," said the manager; "I am much
obliged to you for informing me of the fact. So, sir,
I am to understand that piebald horses are exempt from
paying at the toll-gate?"</p>

<p>"What I zed I bides by. They there spekkady hosses
never pay no turnpikes here in Cornwall. What they
may do elsewhere, I can't zay."</p>

<p>The lunatic watched the cavalcade proceed down the
hill, and when it reached the turnpike, he enjoyed
watching a lively altercation going on between the
toll-taker and the manager. Presently the latter came
galloping back, very hot and angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by telling me that in Cornwall
piebald horses pay no turnpike?"</p>

<p>"Right it is so&mdash;cos <i>you</i> have to pay it vor 'un,"
said the man and stepped out of reach inside the wall.</p>

<p>One day this same man was put to watch a raving
maniac, who, for his own safety, when the fit was on
him, used to be put in a padded room. There was an
eyehole in the door, and the lunatic, whom Mr. Collier
calls Daniel, was set to watch him. The poor wretch
in his ravings called, "Bring down the baggonets! Oh,
marcy on me! Forty thousand Roosians! Oh! oh!
oh! I wish I was in Abraham's bosom," and began to
kick and plunge furiously. On which Daniel shouted
to him through the hole, "Why I tell'ee if you was,
you'd kick the guts out of 'un."</p>

<p>Daniel came from Tavistock, where he used to walk
out with a girl. As he told the story himself&mdash;"I was
keepin' company with a maid, and I went to the parson.
Says I to he, 'I want you, however, to promise me wan
thing,' says I. 'What is it?' says he. 'I want you to
promise me,' says I, 'never to marry me to thickee
there maid when I be drunk.' He zaid he'd promise
me that, quite sure. 'Thankee, your honour,' said I;
'then I'm all right, for I'll take damned good care
you never do it when I'm zober.'"</p>

<p>Daniel was then in the Volunteers and was out on
Whitchurch Down in a review. An officer rode up to
the bugler, and said "Sound a retreat!" The bugler
tried, but could produce no sound. "Sound a retreat!"
roared the officer. Again the bugle would not speak.
"Sound a retreat!" shouted the officer for the third
time. "Don't you see that the cavalry are charging
down on us?" "There now, I can't," replied the
bugler; "for why? I've gone and spit my quid of
terbaccer in the mouthpiece o'un."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks no doubt was quite justified in picking up and
appropriating to himself stories wherever he could find
them and from whomsoever he heard them. A common
friend of ours was with him one day in Plymouth, and
as they sat on the Hoe my friend told Hicks a couple
of racy anecdotes about his own work.</p>

<p>That evening both dined with Lord Mount Edgcumbe,
and Hicks told both these stories with immense
humour, as though they had happened recently&mdash;the
previous week&mdash;to himself.</p>

<p>And certainly some of Hicks's stories are very old
chestnuts.</p>

<p>This, for instance, was told by Hicks as having to
his knowledge occurred to two brothers, Jemmy and
Sammy, in the Jamaica Inn, on the Bodmin Moors,
between that town and Launceston.</p>

<p>They were to sleep in a double-bedded room, and
they dined and drank pretty freely&mdash;the Jamaica Inn is
now a temperance house&mdash;and went to bed. Before
retiring to rest one of them put out the light.</p>

<p>After they had been in bed a little while Jemmy said,
"I say, Sammy, there be a feller in my bed."</p>

<p><i>Sammy</i>&mdash;"So there be in mine."</p>

<p><i>Jemmy</i>&mdash;"What shall you do, Sammy?"</p>

<p><i>Sammy</i>&mdash;"Kick 'un out."</p>

<p><i>Jemmy</i>&mdash;"So shall I."</p>

<p>So they both proceeded to kick furiously, with the
result that each fell out on the opposite side of the bed.
By mistake in the dark the last to put out the light and
go to bed had entered his brother's bed.</p>

<p>I have heard the same tale told of the Yorkshire
moors some thirty to forty years ago.</p>

<p>The famous story of Rabbits and Onions, that Hicks
would tell in such a way as to bring the tears rolling
down the cheeks with laughter, may or may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
founded on fact, or it may be&mdash;and that is probably the
case&mdash;a condensation into one tale of a good deal of
experience with juries. But the same story is told by
Rosegger of a trial in Styria.</p>

<p>The following is almost certainly genuine. Anyhow,
it is an excellent example of the way in which
Hicks could put a story.</p>

<p>"I met a man [name given] in Bodmin, and said to
him, 'You are not looking well. What is the matter?'</p>

<p>"The man replied that he had spent an indifferent
night.</p>

<p>"'How is that?' I inquired.</p>

<p>"'I sleep with father,' he replied; 'and I woke up
all in the dead waste and middle of the night, and I
reached forth my hand and couldn't feel nothing; so I
ses, ses I, "Wherever is my poor dear old aged tender
parent?" I got out of bed and strick a light, all in the
dead waste and middle of the night, and sarched the
room; sarched under the bed and in the cupboards;
and ses I, "Wherever is my poor dear old aged tender
parent?"</p>

<p>"'I went down over the stairs, all in the dead waste
and middle of the night, and sarched under the stairs
and in the kitchen; and ses I, "Wherever is my poor
dear old aged tender parent?"</p>

<p>"'Then I went to the coal-hole, all in the dead
waste and middle of the night, and sarched all about;
and ses I, "Wherever is my poor dear old aged tender
parent?"</p>

<p>"'And I went down into the garden, all in the dead
waste and middle of the night; and ses I, "Wherever
is my poor dear old aged tender parent?"</p>

<p>"'I went down to the parzley bed, all in the dead waste
and middle of the night, and there I found 'un. He'd a
cut his throat with the rape(ing)-hook. I took 'un by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
the hair of his head, and I zaid, ses I, "You darned old
grizzley blackguard, you've brought disgrace on the
family." I brought 'un in, and laid 'un on the table, and
rinned for the doctor; and he zewed up the throt o'un
avore the vital spark was 'xtinct. Zo you zee, Mr.
Hicks, I've had rather an indiffer'nt night.'"</p>

<p>Here is another of Hicks's stories:&mdash;</p>

<p>A young curate was teaching some boys in the
Sunday-school, and was impressing on them the duties to
their parents.</p>

<p>"What do you owe your mother, Bill Lemon?"</p>

<p>"I don't owe her nothin'! her never lent me
nothin'."</p>

<p>"But she takes care of you."</p>

<p>The boy stared.</p>

<p>"What does she do for you?"</p>

<p>"Her gives me a skat in the vace sometimes, and
tells me to go to"&mdash;&mdash;(curate intervenes).</p>

<p>"That is not what I mean. When you are sick,
what does she do?"</p>

<p>"Wipes it op."</p>

<p>Hicks, as already intimated, was a very short man,
very rotund about the belly. Following the Mayor of
Bodmin into the room on the occasion of a public
dinner, he heard the Mayor announced in a voice of
thunder, "The Mayor of Bodmin." Following directly
after he intimated to the butler "and the Corporation."
The man, without a moment's consideration, roared out,
"and the Corporation."</p>

<p>A man of Hicks's acquaintance&mdash;every man of whom
he had a story to tell was an acquaintance&mdash;made a bet
that he would drink a certain number of gallons of
cider in a given time. The trial of the feat came off,
and the man was reduced to the last stage of helplessness,
in an armchair, his head resting on the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
chair, his mouth open, utterly unable to proceed,
when he sighed out to his backers, "Try the taypot!"
The spout was used to pour down the liquor and the
bet was won.</p>

<p>Hicks had a story of a farmer whom he knew intimately,
and who had been canvassed for the approaching
election, and had promised his vote to the lady of
the candidate. Said she, "Dear Mr. Polkinghorne,
when you come up to town, do come and see us, come any
time&mdash;come to dinner. You are sure to be welcome."</p>

<p>Now, as it so fell out, Zechariah Polkinghorne did
go to London on some business, and in the evening,
when his work was over, he called at the member's
house. As it happened that evening, a dinner party
was given. When his name was taken up, the member's
wife said: "Good gracious! What is to be done?
We must, I suppose, have him in, or he will be mortally
offended, and next election will not only vote against
us, but influence a good many more voters."</p>

<p>So Mr. Polkinghorne was shown up into a room full
of ladies and gentlemen in evening dress, and felt somewhat
out of it. Presently dinner was announced and he
went in with the rest and took his place at the table.</p>

<p>"So sorry, Mr. Polkinghorne," said the lady of the
house; "so sorry we have no partner for you to take in;
but, you see, you came unexpectedly, and we had not
time to invite a lady for you."</p>

<p>"Never mind, ma'am, never mind. It doth remind
me o' my old sow to home. Her had thirteen little piglings&mdash;zuckers&mdash;for
a brood, and pore thing had only
twelve little contrivances for them to zuck to."</p>

<p>"What did the thirteenth do then, Mr. Polkinghorne?"</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am, thickey there little zucker was like
me now&mdash;just out in the cold."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span></p>

<p>Hicks was driving along a road in the dark one night
when he came upon an empty conveyance, and two
men close to the hedge on the roadside. One man was
drunk&mdash;a Methodist class-leader&mdash;but the other was
sober. The drunken man was lamenting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, too bad! What shall I do when I be called to
my last account? What shall I zay?"</p>

<p>"Zay, Nathaniel?" the sober man said. "What can
'ee zay but that you've been to Liskeard a auditing of
accounts, and took an extra glass? 'Twill be overlooked
for once, sure enough, up there."</p>

<p>A day or so after Hicks met the sober man, and asked
how Nathaniel had got on that night.</p>

<p>The answer was: "He's a terrible affectionate man to
his family, and when we got home he took the babby
out o' the cradle for to kiss 'un, and valled vore with
'un over a vaggot of vurze. Jane, her got into a
passion and laid onto 'un with the broomstick, while he
kep' tumblin' over the babby. When I comed away
her'd 'a thrashed 'un sober; and they'd 'a got the
babby on the dresser, naked, and was a-picking out the
prickles."</p>

<p>Hicks knew a man who was of a morose, fanatical
humour; and this man had married a widow with a
brisk, merry wench for a daughter. Once he reproved
the girl for singing secular songs in this vale of woe,
and said to her: "Suppose you was took sudden, and
called to your last account with the <i>Soldier's Tear</i> in
your mouth?"</p>

<p>Another of his stories was of a chapel where they
sang a Cornish anthem; the females began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh for a man! oh for a man! oh for a mansion in the sky!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which the men, basses and tenors, responded&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Send down sal! send down sal! send down salvation from on high!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>
<p>A boy at church&mdash;another of Hicks's anecdotes; he
knew the boy well&mdash;heard the parson give out the banns
of "John So-and-so and Betsy So-and-so, both of this
parish. This is the third and last time of asking."</p>

<p>"Mother," said the lad after service; "I shouldn't
like it to be proclaimed in church that sister Jane had
been askin' for a husband dree times afore her got one."</p>

<p>Again, another story told by Hicks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where be you a-bound to this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Gwain to see the football match."</p>

<p>"Aw! Like to be a good un?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon. There be a lot o' bitter feelin' betwixt
the two teams."</p>

<p>But, indeed, the stories told by William Robert
Hicks were many, and for those who would desire
more, let them get Mr. W. F. Collier's <i>Tales and Sayings
of W. R. Hicks</i>, Plymouth, Brendon and Son, 1893;
and look at "An Illustrious Obscure," by Abraham
Hayward, <span class="smcap">q.c.</span>, in the <i>Morning Post</i>, 8th September,
1868; and J. C. Young's <i>Memoirs of C. M. Young</i>,

<p>Hicks died at Bodmin 5th September, 1868, at the
age of sixty.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN TOBIAS MARTIN</h2>


<p>Tobias Martin, better known as Cap'n
Toby, was born in the parish of Wendron
on January 5th, 1747, and was the son of a
father of the same name, who was a common
working miner, but afterwards was advanced to be
a mine agent, or captain of a mine, which situation he
retained during the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>The elder Cap'n Toby was passionately fond of reading,
and read promiscuously whatever came into his
hand. But his main literary passion was for poetry,
and he speedily conceived that he possessed the poetic
<i>afflatus</i>, because he could string lines together that
rhymed more or less well. He went to a mine near
Helston, but was never in sufficiently good circumstances
to be able to give his children a moderate, let
alone a superior education.</p>

<p>Tobias, his second son, inherited the father's love of
reading and liking for the Muse, and as a boy he
bitterly lamented that he was not sent to school.</p>

<p>Deprived through his father's poverty or negligence
of the means of education enjoyed by others, he resolved
on supplying the deficiencies of such instruction
by self-application.</p>

<p>From an early age he was employed at the tin-stamping
mills near Helston and Redruth. After he became
a man he worked underground on his own account, i.e.
in working setts that he had taken, and at other times
on what is termed among miners "tutwork and tribute."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a great ambition to learn French, and studied
diligently a French grammar that he found among his
father's books; but, of course, remained perfectly
ignorant of the pronunciation, though able to write
a few sentences and read a book in that language.</p>

<p>Proud of the former capability, he composed some
lines in French, or what he supposed to be French,
and wrote them on the belfry door. A Mr. William
Sandys, an attorney at Helston, happening to see these
lines, inquired who had written them, and when he
learned that they were by Toby Martin, he gave him
a letter to a Mrs. Brown, who had resided some time
in France, and was believed to have the language
at her tongue's end, to this effect: "The Bearer,
Tobias Martin, wishes to learn French, but his pockets
are low." From her Toby did receive some
lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandys occasionally employed him, as he could
write well, to assist in his office; he also appointed him
toller of the dues arriving from tin-bounds in Breage,
belonging to the Praed family, which appointment he
held to the time of his death.</p>

<p>In 1772 he married Mary Peters, of Helston, and by
her had ten children, four sons and six daughters. In
the same year, and, indeed, at the very same time, Mr.
Sandys offered him a situation as escort to his eldest
son, Mr. William Sandys, into France, where the latter
was to remain so as to acquire proficiency in the French
language. And&mdash;what was somewhat rough on Toby&mdash;he
had to leave with his charge the day after his
marriage. The place chosen for William Sandys to
acquire French was singularly badly chosen: it was
Painpol, in Brittany, where the natives talk Breton,
and what French they do speak is of an inferior quality
and very unlike that spoken in Paris or Touraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p>After having seen his charge safe to Painpol, Toby
returned to Helston and to his wife.</p>

<p>Next year (1773) in August Toby was despatched
again to Painpol, this time to bring young William
home. On his return he set to work to acquire the
Dutch language and learn Latin; but, indeed, there
was scarcely a subject that did not attract him, and that
he did not strive to acquire some knowledge of. It was
unfortunate for him that his studies were so desultory,
that he was "Jack of many trades and master of none."</p>

<p>Some years after his return from France he was
appointed captain at Camborne Vean Mine. He also
held the situation of managing agent of Wheal Heriot's
Foot, commonly called Herod's Foot, near Liskeard.</p>

<p>A story is told of him which Mr. Tregellas gives in
his <i>Cornish Character and Characteristics</i> under a
fictitious name. Captain Toby was having his pint of
ale at a tavern, when in comes a miner who was wont
to be called "Old Blowhard," and was not esteemed
trusty or diligent as a workman.</p>

<p>"How are 'ee, Capp'n?" says Bill.</p>

<p>"Clever. How art thee?"</p>

<p>"Purty well as for health," says Bill, "but I want a
job. Can 'ee give us waun ovver to your new bal?"</p>

<p>"No, we're full," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"How many men have 'ee goat ovver theere?" asked
Old Blowhard.</p>

<p>"How many? Why we've two sinking a air-shaft
through the flockan, and two to taakle, and that's
fower; and theere's two men in the oddit, and a booay
to car tools and that, and that makes three moore, and
that oaltogether es seben."</p>

<p>"And how many cappuns have 'ee goat?" said Bill.</p>

<p>"How many? Why ten."</p>

<p>"What! ten cappuns to watch over seben men? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
doan't b'lieve you can maake that out, for the 'venturers
would'n stand it."</p>

<p>"'Tes zackly so then, and I'll maak it out to 'ee in
a moment. Waun cappun es 'nough we oal knaw, but
at the laast mittin, the 'venturers purposed to have waun
of the 'venturers' sons maade a cappun, and to larn, they
said; and so a draaper's son, called Sems, was put weth
me from school, at six pound a month, and a shaare of
what we had in the 'count-house."</p>

<p>"Well, but how can you maake ten of you and he?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll tell 'ee how, and you mind 'nother time,
Bill, for theere's somethin' of scholarin' in ut. Now see
this: I myself am waun, baent I?"</p>

<p>"Iss, sure," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, and theest oft to knaw that young Sems es
nawthin'; well, when theest ben to school so long as I
have, theest knaw that waun with a nought attached to
un do maake 10, and so 'tes zackly like that."</p>

<p>In the year 1790 Toby's wife died, and he was left
with all his ten children on his hands. One of these
soon died, and he sent for the sexton, who, after having
been regaled with liquor, declared with gushing emotion,
"Lor' bless ee, Cap'n Toby, I'd as soon deg a
grave for 'ee as for any man with whom I be acquainted."
In 1792 he married Ann James, a widow,
who kept a small public-house at Porthleven, and by
her had four children, two sons and two daughters.</p>

<p>A short time after his marriage he took the Horse
and Jockey Tavern in Helston, which he kept for four
years, and then the "Helston Arms," of which he was
host for five more. He still retained his situation of
mine-agent in Wheal Ann tin mine in Wendron, about
two and a half miles from Helston, where, on quitting
the last-mentioned inn, and after the mine had failed,
he lived for some years as captain of Wheal Trevenen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
which was run by a company, but the smelting was
consigned to a speculator of Truro named Daubuz,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
who had with him one Coad as a clerk. After a while
Martin supposed that Daubuz was swindling the company,
and about the same time Coad quarrelled with
Daubuz, and pretended to reveal how he had been
cheating; thereupon the Adventurers set up their own
smelting works. Martin's account of Daubuz must
not be accepted as true. He wrote full of vindictive
hate. Anyhow, a misunderstanding arose between
him and the company respecting his accounts. The
Adventurers debited him with a large sum, which
ought to have been and was afterwards charged to
the purser. In September, 1811, at a general meeting
of the Adventurers, a Mr. Wyatt, auditor of
the accounts, accused Captain Toby of having falsified
his books. This he stoutly denied, and insisted
that his accounts were correct. In November, 1811,
he received his dismissal, not as having acted fraudulently,
but on the plea that he was too old and past
work. He was discharged accordingly in his sixty-second
year, and he applied for and got work at other
mines. A year passed before Captain Toby could have
his accounts investigated, and then he received from
the purser a copy of an account, wherein a balance of
£109 6s. 6d. appeared against him. To this he objected,
and a dispute arose that lasted some time.</p>

<p>On February 1st, 1812, he was arrested for debt, and
confined in the sheriff's ward at Bodmin for over two
months before an accommodation was arrived at, and
he was discharged.</p>

<p>As he could not get Mr. Wyatt to have the accounts
inspected, for he proved shifty, Captain Toby was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
obliged to appeal to the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries
to issue an order for the investigation of the accounts.
This alarmed Wyatt, and it was mutually agreed
that they should be gone through by Mr. Richard
Tyacke, of Godolphin. Mr. Tyacke in a very short
time found that the balance against Martin was only
£29 18s. 4d., and that then there was owing to him from
the company nearly a twelvemonth's wage. He accordingly
in February, 1813, published the following
notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<i>To the Public.</i></p>

<p>"Having been requested to examine some disputed
accounts between Trevenen Adventurers and Captain
Tobias Martin, I find from investigation that the errors
in dispute were <i>not</i> contained in his account, but in
those prepared against him.</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Richard Tyacke.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>After this he received from the company the balance
of his salary, and that put an end to the business. His
connection with Wheal Trevenen having ceased, he
worked at Wheal Vorah as captain to 1817, when he
was in his sixty-ninth year. Then he was appointed
storekeeper to the mine and to keep the stock accounts
at six guineas per month; and this situation he filled
till March, 1817, when in his seventy-ninth year he
was superannuated at three and a half guineas per
month.</p>

<p>On June 4th, 1825, his wife died, and not long
after he received the news of the death of his
eldest son, Tobias, under tragical circumstances, at
Washington, U.S.A. The younger Tobias and his
wife had a daughter, a child who went gathering fruit
in the hedges of some land belonging to a rough
fellow, who finding her there, carried away her basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
and took as well some of her wearing apparel. When
Tobias Martin the younger heard of this he and his
wife went to remonstrate and ask for the return of the
basket and the garments. An altercation ensued, and
the man of whom they complained with his revolver
shot Tobias Martin dead.</p>

<p>This shock broke down the old captain. He had
always loved his glass, but now he took to it more
freely than ever, and was often intoxicated.</p>

<p>He died on April 9th, 1828, in the eighty-first year
of his age, and he was buried in Breage churchyard.</p>

<p>Captain Tobias Martin's poems were published at
Helston in 1831, and a second edition in 1856. They
are absolutely worthless as poetry, and one may look
in vain through them to find an original or a poetic
idea. But as we have given this man's life, a specimen
of the stuff he wrote must also be given, and one of
his shortest compositions will suffice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, sweet content! best gift of bounteous heav'n,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Correct my mind and bend my stubborn ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis thou alone canst make life's journey even,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And crown with happiness my future days.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In his religious views Toby Martin was a Deist or
Unitarian. In personal appearance he was inclined
to corpulency. His countenance was large and open,
and he stood five feet nine inches high.</p>

<h2>THE MAYOR OF BODMIN</h2>


<p>When Henry VIII died, Edward VI was
aged but ten, and the unprincipled Protector
Somerset took the reins of power into
his own hands; and as he was a strong
partisan of the reformers, and enriched himself on the
plunder of the Church, he carried out what he considered
to be reforms with a high hand, with the assistance
of the Council, which was filled with creatures
equally rapacious and equally devoid of principle. As
the monasteries had all been suppressed, and the
monks and nuns turned adrift, these poor homeless
wretches wandered over the country entreating alms.
In November, 1548, an Act was passed ordering all
such to be branded on the hand, and on repetition of
the offence to be adjudged to slavery.</p>

<p>The baneful effects of the dissolution of the monasteries
had, moreover, been severely felt by the people,
for the monks had been ever ready to afford shelter and
relief in sickness or distress, and the indigent were
now driven to frightful extremities throughout the land,
much as would be the case nowadays were the workhouses
and poor laws to be abolished. The monks,
moreover, had been most kind and considerate landlords,
and, always residing in their monasteries, what
money they drew in rents from their tenants was spent
on the land. But no sooner were the rapacious hands
of the nobles laid on the property of the Church, than
these new proprietors demanded exorbitant rents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
very generally spent the money in London. The
cottagers were reduced to misery by the enclosure of
the commons on which they had formerly fed their
cattle.</p>

<p>Added to all this came violent changes in the services
of the Church. Candles were forbidden to be carried
on Candlemas Day, ashes to be used on Ash Wednesday,
and palms on Palm Sunday; all images were to
be removed from the churches, and even the sacred
form of the Redeemer on the Cross above the rood
was not respected.</p>

<p>Several of the bishops objected to these proceedings,
but Somerset was inexorable. Then several colleges,
chantries, and free chapels, as well as fraternities and
guilds, were abolished, and their lands and goods confiscated
to the King, which, being sold at very small
prices, enriched many of the Protestant hangers-on of
the Court, and strengthened their resolution to maintain
the changes.</p>

<p>These violent and hasty proceedings provoked widespread
discontent and even exasperation. The first
disturbances arose in the county of Cornwall, where
one Body, a commissioner sent down to "purify" the
churches, was stabbed in the back whilst pulling down
images in a church.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Thence they quickly spread into
the counties of Devon, Wilts, Somerset, Hants, Sussex,
Kent, Essex, Gloucester, Hereford, Worcester,
Leicester, Oxford, Norfolk, and York. In most parts
the rioters were quickly put down, but the disorders
in Devonshire and Norfolk threatened more dangerous
consequences (1549). The commotion first broke out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
at Sampford Courtenay on Whit Monday, the day after
the Act for reforming the Church Service had been
put in force. The people assembled and forced the
priest to say Mass in the ancient manner, instead of
using the Book of Common Prayer. The commotion
spread through the adjoining parishes, and many came
up out of Cornwall; many of the disaffected gentry
of the two counties placed themselves at the head
of the insurgents; among them were Sir Thomas
Pomeroy, Mr. Coffin, and Mr. Humphry Arundell,
and the body swelled to 10,000 men. They then laid
siege to Exeter, but the citizens shut their gates
against them. Some attempts were made to scale
the walls, which being repulsed, the rebels endeavoured
to gain admittance by burning the gates.
The citizens, by adding more wood to the fires, kept
the enemy back till they had raised fresh defences
within. After this the insurgents sought to effect a
breach by mining the walls. Having completed their
mine, laid their powder, and rammed the mouth, before
they could explode it the citizens had drenched the
powder by means of a countermine filled with water.</p>

<p>Lord Russell, glutted with the plunder of the
Church, was sent to relieve the city, but the rebels
cut down trees and laid them in his way, so that he
could not approach, and after burning some villages
he determined on withdrawing to Honiton. He now
found his retreat cut off, and he was constrained to
give battle on Clyst Heath, and defeated them with
great slaughter, killing 600 men. "Such was the
valour and stoutness of these men," says Hooker,
"that the Lord Grey reported himself that he never,
in all the wars that he had been in, did know the like."
The ringleaders were taken and executed. The vicar
of S. Thomas by Exeter, who was with them, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
conveyed to his church and hanged from the tower,
where his body was left to dangle for four years.</p>

<p>The defeat was on the 7th August, and the rebels
were pursued to Launceston, every one falling into the
hands of the King's troops being put to death.
Arundell and other gentlemen were, however, taken
prisoners. The Lords of the Council wrote to Lord
Russell on the 21st August congratulating him on his
success, and directing him to search for Sir Thomas
Pomeroy, and to "send up Sir Humphry Arundell,
Maunder, and the Mayor of Bodmin, and two or three
of the rankest traitors." They desired him to delay
a short time the issue of a general pardon. In the
same month Lord Russell, William, Lord Grey of
Wilton, and Sir William Herbert, informed the
Council that they sent up Pomeroy, Arundell, and
other prisoners; and they observed that Castle,
Arundell's secretary, went up not as a prisoner, but
as an accuser of his former employer.</p>

<p>Nicholas Boyer, the Mayor of Bodmin, had escaped
capture. But the King's army pursued the dispersed
Cornishmen into the duchy; and Sir Anthony Kingston,
Provost-Marshal, arrived at Bodmin, where the
Mayor was snugly ensconced in his house, and congratulating
himself on his escape, trusted that it was
not known that he had taken part in the rising.</p>

<p>No sooner was Sir Anthony in the town than he
wrote to Boyer, announcing his intention of dining
with him on a certain day. The Mayor felt highly
honoured at such a mark of confidence and condescension,
and made great preparations, brought out his
best plate and linen and wine, and ordered pasties and
siskins and dainty cates of all kinds to be prepared in
his kitchen, so as to receive his guest with becoming
hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p>A little before dinner the Provost took him aside and
whispered in his ear that execution must that day be
done in the town, and nowhere so suitably as in the
street in front of Boyer's door, and he desired that a
gallows might be erected by the time the dinner was
ended. The Mayor complied with the request, and
during the meal the hammering of the carpenters could
be heard. The Provost was cheery and jocose, and if
Boyer had been nervous at first, this wore off under the
friendly conversation of his guest.</p>

<p>When dinner was concluded, Sir Anthony asked if
the little job he had ordered had been carried out, and
when Boyer assured him that it was so, "I pray you,"
said the Provost, "bring me to the place." Thereupon
he took the Mayor by the hand and led him forth
before his door, in the kindliest manner imaginable.</p>

<p>On seeing the gallows, the Provost asked Boyer
whether he thought them strong enough to sustain the
weight of a stout man. "Aye," replied the Mayor;
"doubtless they be so."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Provost, "get up speedily,
for they are prepared for you."</p>

<p>"I hope," exclaimed the astonished and disconcerted
Mayor, "that you mean not what you speak."</p>

<p>"In very faith," said Sir Anthony Kingston, "there
is no remedy, for you have been a busy rebel."</p>

<p>And so, without trial or defence, he was hanged
before his own door by the man who had just dined at
his table.</p>

<p>Sir John Hayward, who relates this incident, tells
also the story of a miller who resided near Bodmin.
This man had been a "busy rebel," and fearing the
wrath of the Provost-Marshal, he told a "sturdy, tall
fellow, his servant," that he had occasion to go from
home, and that if any one should inquire for the miller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
the fellow should affirm that he was the man, and that
he had been so for three years. The Provost came to
the mill and inquired for the miller, and the servant
at once presented himself as such. The Provost inquired
how long he had kept the mill. "These three
years," answered the servant.</p>

<p>"String him up on the nearest tree!" ordered Sir
Anthony.</p>

<p>The fellow then cried out that he was not the miller,
but the miller's man. "Nay, sir," said the Provost,
"I will take thee at thy word; and if thou beest the
miller, thou art a busy knave; if thou beest not, thou
art a false lying knave; whatsoever thou art, thou
shalt be hanged." When others told him that the
man was in reality only the miller's servant, the Provost
replied, "Could he ever have done his master a better
service than to hang in his stead?" and so he was
despatched.</p>

<p>Hals says: "Mayow, of Cleoyan, in S. Columb
Major, was hanged at a tavern signpost in that town,
of whom tradition says his crime was not capital; and
therefore his wife was advised by her friends to hasten
to the town after the Marshal and his men, who had
him in custody, and beg for his life, which accordingly
she prepared to do. And to render herself the more
amiable petitioner before the Marshal's eyes, this dame
spent so much time in attiring herself, and putting on
her French hood, then in fashion, that her husband
was put to death before her arrival. In like manner
the Marshal hanged John Payne, the mayor or portreeve
of St. Ives, on a gallows erected in the middle
of that town, whose arms are still to be seen in one
of the fore seats in that church, viz. in a plain field,
three pineapples."</p>

<p>Humphry Arundell, who had headed the rebels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
was the son of Roger Arundell, of Helland, and he
had been appointed Governor of S. Michael's Mount
in 1539. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
John Fulford. After his capture he was taken up to
London, confined in the Tower, and hanged at Tyburn,
27th January, 1549-50. Sir Thomas Pomeroy, of Berry
Pomeroy, managed to save his life, but suffered severely
in his estate. He married Jane, daughter of Sir Piers
Edgcumbe, of Cothele.</p>

<p>Strype tells us that "when this rebellion was well
allayed, it was remembered how the bells in the
churches served, by ringing, to summon and call in
the disaffected unto their arms. Therefore, in September,
an order was sent down from the Council to the Lord
Russell, to execute a work that proved no doubt highly
disgustful to the people, viz. to take away all the bells
in Devonshire and Cornwall, leaving only one in each
steeple, which was to call the people to church. And
this partly to prevent the like insurrection for the
future, and partly to help to defray the charges the
King had been at among them."</p>

<p>Strype adds that "two gentlemen of those parts,
Champion (Champernon) and (Sir John) Chichester,
assistant perhaps against the rebels, took this opportunity
to get themselves rewarded, by begging, not the
bells, but the bell-clappers only, which was granted
them, with the ironwork and furniture thereunto belonging.
And no question they made good benefit
thereof."</p>

<h2>JOHN NICHOLS TOM,</h2>

<h4><i>alias</i> SIR WILLIAM COURTENAY, K.M.</h4>


<p>This strange man was the son of William
Tom, landlord of the "Joiners' Arms," S.
Columb, and of his wife Charity Bray&mdash;"Cracked
Charity" was the nickname she
bore&mdash;who died in the County Lunatic Asylum, and it
was from his mother that the subject of this memoir
derived the bee that was in his bonnet.</p>

<p>John Nichols was born at S. Columb Major on
November 10th, 1799, and he owed his name to a kinsman
of his mother&mdash;his godfather, a well-to-do-farmer,
who was unmarried.</p>

<p>At an early age John Nichols Tom showed a mischievous
disposition. He was turned out of the dame's
school at which he had been placed for cutting off the
whiskers of her favourite cat. At the next school
where he was placed he exhibited the characteristic
vanity that was a leading feature through life. He
liked to be thought to know more than any of his
fellow pupils. One day he propounded to them the
question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is Neptune? I bet none of you know."</p>

<p>"Neptune," replied one urchin, "is my father's Newfoundland
dog."</p>

<p>"Then who is Venus?"</p>

<p>"She is mother's spaniel bitch," answered one of the
boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span></p>

<p>John Nichols in a fury fell on both with his fists.</p>

<p>"No such thing. Neptune is a god, and Venus is a
goddess."</p>

<p>A general fray was the result, out of which our hero
came mauled.</p>

<p>When it became time for him to strike out a course
in life, he was placed in an attorney's office, and he
conducted himself there well.</p>

<p>A fire broke out on the premises of the elder Tom
and consumed the house. This occasioned Mrs. Tom
to sink into a condition of profound melancholy, and
she rapidly became so wholly insane that she had to be
confined in an asylum, where some years later she
died, and then Mr. Tom married a schoolmistress who
lived on the other side of the road. This did not
please John Nichols, and he quitted the attorney's
office and was placed in the firm of Plumer and
Turner, wine merchants and maltsters at Truro, as
cellarman. After five years' service the firm came to
an end, and Tom then began to trade on his own
account. He married Catherine, second daughter of a
Mr. Philpot, of Truro, whose elder sister Julia was
engaged to a Mr. Hugo. Tom moved into his father-in-law's
house, which was old and dilapidated, and
rebuilt it as a commodious mansion, with spacious
premises in its rear for the carrying on of the business
of a maltster. But on a sudden a fire broke out in
this newly-constructed malt-house, and speedily consumed
all that had been built for his business. Folk
naturally concluded that, as Tom had recently had
some losses, he had set fire to his premises, that were
insured for £3000, and they remembered that his
father's house had also been insured and been burnt
down. But Tom demanded that a most searching
inquiry should be made as to the cause of the fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
the insurance company, satisfying itself that it was
accidental, paid the sum without demur. With the
money thus received he rebuilt his premises, and continued
the business. Those who saw much of him
were convinced that, as they termed it, "there was a
screw loose somewhere." He affected an unusual
dress, and tried to induce his wife to assume a habit
that would have caused her to be mobbed in the streets.
He moreover became great as an orator, denouncing
the Church, the aristocracy, and all organized governments.
In a word, he was a Socialist of the day.</p>

<p>Two years later he made a considerable sum of
money by a successful venture in malt at Liverpool.
The result of the transaction may be gathered from

"<span class="smcap">My dear Wife</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I merely wish to inform you that I have just
discharged the vessel of the malt, which has given
every satisfaction to the purchasers. The measurement
has exceeded my expectations by twenty-four Winchesters.
There are the malt sacks in the vessel, and
also half a bushel of the bottom scrapings; this you
will get screened immediately. I am well and in good
spirits (thank God for it). As I shall write to you again
in a day or two, my letter will be short. The letter
you will receive by post shall contain all I have to say,
and as it will be subsequent to this I need not prolong.
I have paid the captain of the vessel all the freight.</p>

<p>
"With the kindest regards to all,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was rational enough, but it was the last
rational act he committed, as this also was the last
time that he signed his name as above.</p>

<p>For some time his imagination had been influenced
by stories that circulated relative to Lady Hester
Stanhope, the "Queen of Lebanon," of her wealth, her
authority over Arabs and Druses, of her prophecies
and expectations of the near coming of the Messiah to
institute the millennium; and he felt convinced that he
was predestined to be the forerunner or herald to
announce the coming advent of Christ. He had read
a translation of Lamartine's <i>Travels in the East</i>, in which
it was stated that, according to Eastern prophecy, the
Messiah would ride into Jerusalem on a mare foaled
ready saddled, and that Lady Hester had such a mare
ready for the advent of the Prince of Peace. "Since
destiny," said Lady Hester to Lamartine, "has sent
you hither&mdash;permit me to confide to you what I have
hitherto concealed from so many of the profane. Come,
and you shall see with your own eyes a prodigy of
Nature, the destination of which is known only to
myself and my immediate votaries. The prophets of
the East have announced it centuries ago, and yourself
shall be judge if a part of those prophecies have not
been accomplished." Lamartine goes on to say:
"She opened a gate of the garden which led into a
smaller inner court, where I perceived two magnificent
Arab mares of the finest blood, and of the most
symmetrical form. 'Approach,' said she to me, 'and
examine that bay mare: see if Nature hath not accomplished
in her everything which is written about the
mare that is to carry the Messiah&mdash;<i>she was foaled</i> ready
saddled!'</p>

<p>"I saw, in fact, in this beautiful animal a freak of
nature. The mare had, in the place of the shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
a cavity so broad and deep, and imitating so well the
form of a Turkish saddle, that it might be said with truth
that she was foaled ready saddled, and but for the want
of stirrups she might have been mounted without experiencing
the want of an artificial saddle."</p>

<p>This account that John Tom had read of Lady
Hester made the most profound impression on his mind,
and inflated as he was with self-conceit and ambition,
he conceived that he was called to take a place beside,
if not before, Lady Hester, as a herald of Christ.
Accordingly, having his pocket full of money from the
sale of his malt, he started for Havre, and thence for
Constantinople and Syria.</p>

<p>For what follows, till his reappearance in England in
December of the same year, 1832, our sole authority is
"Canterburiensis," who wrote Tom's life, but who does
not tell us what were his authorities, and who certainly
so embroidered some of the facts he relates, that in
instances we feel uncertain whether they are facts or
fables.</p>

<p>According to this authority he arrived at Beirout,
at what date we are not informed, and he at once presented
himself before the English consul, under the
assumed name of Sir William Courtenay, Knight, and
requested an escort to the Lebanon, where he desired
to see Hester Stanhope, and acquaint her with the fact
that he was the forerunner of the expected Messiah.
The consul saw that the man was not wholly sane, and
he was in a dilemma what to do with him; finally he
concluded that it would not be unwise to send one mad
head to the other, and see what would be the result.
Accordingly he gave Sir William, as we must now call
him, an escort and he departed for her Lebanon residence,
at Dgioun.</p>

<p>"On arriving at the principal entrance, Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
sent forward his dragoman to announce to the slave,
who was standing at the door, that a person of consequence,
on a mission of high import, requested an
interview with Lady Hester Stanhope. Sir William
and the dragoman were accordingly conducted into a
narrow cell, deprived almost of all light, and almost
destitute of furniture; here they were ordered to wait,
until the pleasure of her ladyship should be known. After
waiting full three hours in the most suffocating heat,
the slave returned with a rather peremptory message,
demanding, on the part of her ladyship, to know who and
what the stranger was who had solicited an interview
with her. Sir William wrote with his pencil, that he
had travelled from the County of Cornwall to announce
to the expectant faithful in the East the approaching
advent of the Messiah, and that as her ladyship had established
herself in the Holy Land for the direct purpose
of awaiting that glorious event, which was so near at
hand, he considered that he was acting in conformity
with the high destiny that was awarded to him to communicate
to her ladyship in person the arrival of the
Millennium, that she might co-operate with him in
spreading the glad tidings throughout the Holy Land,
and acknowledge him as the harbinger of the great event.</p>

<p>"Fully satisfied that Lady Hester Stanhope would
in a short time rush into his arms and hail him as the
accredited messenger of Heaven, Sir William felt not
the torrid heat, but stood in dignified complacency with
himself, proudly awaiting the result of his message.
In a very short time the slave returned, followed by
several others, and it would be a difficult task to
describe the astonishment and indignation of Sir
William when he was informed that it was the decided
opinion of her ladyship that he was an impostor, for
that not one of the prophecies had been as yet fulfilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
which were to precede the coming of the Messiah, nor
in any one of those prophecies was the slightest
mention made of a messenger being appointed to announce
His coming, and that accordingly the sooner
he returned to his native country, the better it would be
for him."</p>

<p>In a word, Sir William was detected, without having
been seen, as an impostor, and was ejected from the
house as such.</p>

<p>We should greatly like to know how much of this is
true. Not only are no dates given, but the name of
the consul at Beirout is also withheld.</p>

<p>Nothing remained for Sir William Courtenay to do
but to retire discomfited to England, and try there
whether he would have better luck. He embarked in a
ship of Beirout for Malta, and after a residence of
about three weeks in that island, sailed for England
and arrived safely in London. The first intimation
that he was back, received in Cornwall, was that he had
assumed the name and title of Sir William Percy
Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, King of
Jerusalem, and Prince of Abyssinia, and that he had
presented himself before the electors of Canterbury to
contest that borough, in December, 1832.</p>

<p>He had taken up his residence at the Rose Hotel,
Canterbury, where his dignified manners, his rich
dress, his professions that he was the rightful owner of
the estates of the Earl of Devon, and that he intended
to establish his claims to them, his assertion that he was
not only Knight of Malta but also <i>de jure</i> King of
Jerusalem, imposed on so many of the burgesses of
Canterbury that he polled 375 votes; but was unsuccessful,
as the opponent candidates, the Honourable R.
Watson and Lord Fordwick gained respectively 832
and 802.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span></p>

<p>After his defeat Tom made a circuit through the
towns and villages of Kent, declaiming against the
poor laws, the revenue laws, and such other portions of
the statutes of the realm as might be considered by the
poor to be adverse to their interests. By his speeches
he obtained great success, and a sort of periodical that
he issued, entitled <i>The Lion</i>, was greedily bought and
distributed. But it ran through eight numbers only.
The full title was "The Lion. The British Lion will
be free. Heaven is his throne and earth is his footstool.
He spake and it was done, he commanded and it stood
fast. Liberty, truth bears off the victory, independence."</p>

<p>He then started for Devonshire, accompanied by a
gentleman who so firmly believed in his pretensions
that he defrayed his expenses to the amount of a thousand
pounds. This man, Mr. George Denne, and a
young surgeon named Robinson were completely
duped by him. "My dearest George," said the
Knight of Malta to the former, "it may please
Heaven to take me in a short time from this sphere
of my sublunary greatness, to translate me to the
beatitude of another world."</p>

<p>"I hope not, Sir William," said George Denne.</p>

<p>"But," continued Sir William, "I shall carry with
me the pleasing satisfaction of having provided in a
truly princely manner for those who, whilst I was
on earth, had the sense and sagacity to see into the
nobility of my character, and to acknowledge me as
Lord Viscount William Courtenay, of Powderham
Castle, Knight of Malta, King of Jerusalem, Prince of
Arabia, King of the Gypsies, and all the other honours
and titles which by descent or creation belong to me.
To you, therefore, George Denne, I bequeath the
Hales' estate, with the proviso that you erect a monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
on the highest ground on that estate to the
memory of me, the great Lord of Devon, the regenerator
of the world, and one of the greatest benefactors whom
the human race ever saw."</p>

<p>In like manner he bequeathed to Mr. Robinson the
whole of Powderham Castle and all its valuable paintings,
together with one-half of the lands belonging to
the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral.</p>

<p>It will hardly be credited to what an extent he was
run after at Canterbury. Professional men, such as
physicians, surgeons, solicitors, also gentlemen of independent
property and tradesmen of the first respectability,
were his staunch supporters, and daily invited
him to their table, and introduced him to the bosom
of their families. The invitations which he received
to dinners, teas, and suppers were so numerous that
he was known to attend several parties in a few hours.
Mothers with marriageable daughters hunted him in
packs.</p>

<p>But&mdash;it was asked&mdash;why did not Sir William take
possession of his extensive estates in Devon? It was
to do this that he started, attended by his faithful
squire, Mr. George Denne. On reaching Exmouth,
Sir William despatched his squire to the authorities
of the place to announce his arrival, and that as Lord
of Devon and King of Jerusalem he would hold a levee
at eight o'clock in the evening, at which he would be
ready to receive them and lay before them his right
and title to Powderham Castle and the estates belonging
to it.</p>

<p>But when the hour of the levee arrived only one man
appeared, and that was the steward of the Earl of Devon,
who came very bluntly to inform him that should he
venture to set foot within the private grounds of Powderham
Castle he would be prosecuted for trespass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day Sir William repaired to the newspaper
office at Exmouth, and drew up an advertisement,
purporting to be an announcement of the arrival of the
rightful Earl of Devon for the purpose of taking possession
of Powderham Castle, and a statement to the
effect that he was now recalled to the metropolis to
appear before the House of Lords to substantiate his
claim. The editor laughed in his face, refused to
insert what was handed over to him, and tore it to
shreds.</p>

<p>Full of wrath, Sir William shook off the dust from
his feet as a testimony against Exmouth, and departed
for London, where he remained two or three days, and
then returned to Canterbury.</p>

<p>There he speedily involved himself in difficulties by
his exertions in favour of some smugglers. An action
had taken place in July, 1833, between the revenue
cutter <i>Lively</i> and the <i>Admiral Hood</i>, smuggler, near
Goodwin Sands, and in the course of the flight of the
latter vessel her crew were observed to throw overboard
a great number of tubs, which on being picked
up proved to contain spirits. The <i>Admiral Hood</i> was
captured, but no contraband goods were found on
board; and on the men being taken into custody, Tom
presented himself as a witness before the magistrates,
and swore most positively that he had seen the whole
affair, and that no tubs had been thrown from the
<i>Admiral Hood</i>; he further stated that he had observed
those which had been picked up by the revenue officers
floating about on the water many hours before the
<i>Admiral Hood</i> came near the Goodwins. This was so
diametrically opposed to the truth that a prosecution
for perjury was resolved on, and he was indicted at the
Maidstone Assizes on July 25th, 1833. It was then
proved that Sir William, on the very day on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
action had taken place, Sunday, the 17th February,
had been twenty-five miles distant at Boughton-under-Blean,
near Canterbury, and at the very hour of the
action had been at church there. A verdict of conviction
followed, and Mr. Justice Park, the presiding
judge, passed a sentence of imprisonment for three
months, to be followed by seven years of transportation
beyond the seas.</p>

<p>This having reached the ears of his relations in
Cornwall, representations were made by them to the
Home Secretary that he was insane, and he was transferred
to a lunatic asylum at Barming Heath, where
he remained for four years, but whence he still issued
addresses to his adherents in Canterbury and interfered
in the election of councillors. There he remained
for five years, and then a determined effort was made
by his father and friends, and by Sir Hussey Brian, to
obtain his liberation, and Lord John Russell ordered
his liberation. This was an electioneering man&#339;uvre,
and Lord John had some difficulty in justifying his
conduct in the House when later taken to task for
having set this madman free.</p>

<p>On quitting the asylum, Tom hoped to take up his
residence with a Mr. G. Francis, with whom he had
been on terms of intimacy before. But Mr. Francis
was by this time disillusioned, and when the Knight of
Malta presented himself before him armed with a new
pair of pistols, he remonstrated with him, and ordered
him to quit the house; when he went to a cottage hard
by occupied by one Wills, who was completely the dupe
of Tom, and a passionate agitator. Then he went to
Bossenden Farm occupied by a person named Culver.
He gave out that he was the true proprietor of many
of the finest estates in Kent, but that he would not
enter into possession for two years. In addition to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
living upon and amongst the farmers, he induced
many of them to give him large sums of money,
promising that for every shilling lent he would return
a pound; and that, when he was in full possession of
his estates, all his followers should have land free from
rent according to their deserts. These promises made
many dupes, and enabled him to indulge in luxuries
which excited the astonishment of those not acquainted
with his resources, and made many believe that he was
what he pretended to be&mdash;really a nobleman of large
property. To keep up this notion he made presents to
various individuals; thus, to a fellow who had been
prosecuted by the Revenue, Courtenay gave two
horses worth £40. He was fond of displaying himself
in fantastic dresses; he allowed his hair and beard, that
was coal-black, to grow long; and he taught his
followers to roar his battle song, of which only a few
verses can be given here:&mdash;</p>

<p>Harrison Ainsworth, who has introduced Courtenay
into his novel <i>Rookwood</i>, thus accurately describes him:
"A magnificent coal-black beard decorated the chin of
this worthy; but this was not all&mdash;his costume was in
perfect keeping with his beard, and consisted of a very
theatrical-looking suit, upon the breast of which was
embroidered in gold wire the Maltese cross; while on
his shoulders were thrown the ample folds of a cloak
of Tyrian hue. To his side was girt a long and
doughty sword, which he termed, in his knightly
phrase, Excalibur; and upon his profuse hair rested
a hat as broad in the brim as a Spanish sombrero.
Exaggerated as this description may appear, we can
assure our readers that it is not overdrawn."</p>

<p>He now resumed his rambles round Kent, and
visited the cottages wherever he went, giving himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
out to be Jesus Christ come back on earth to sift
the wheat from the chaff before setting up his millennial
kingdom. He showed his hands and feet and
side marked with red&mdash;but there must have been conscious
fraud on his part, for after his death no such
scars could be found. Many of the poor and ignorant
believed in him and followed him. His head-quarters
were for a while the house of one of his most devoted
followers named Wills, but he presently left that and removed
to a farmhouse at Boughton, where lived a farmer
called Culver, who was also a believer. He infatuated
the women even more than the men, for he was tall,
dark, and handsome, and they took up his cause passionately,
and urged their husbands and fathers to follow
him, "because he was the very Christ, and unless
they adhered to him fire would come down from Heaven
and consume them."</p>

<p>Instances occurred, and that by no means infrequently,
in which he presented himself to be worshipped
as God by the ignorant peasantry.</p>

<p>At length this excitement was destined to be brought
to a conclusion.</p>

<p>On Monday, May 28th, 1838, Tom, with about fifteen
followers, sallied forth from the village of Boughton
without having any very distinct object in view, and
proceeded to the cottage of Wills. Here they formed
in column; and a loaf having been procured it was
placed at the top of a pole, which bore a flag of blue
and white, upon which a lion rampant was drawn.
Wills having joined them, they marched to Goodrestone,
near Faversham; and on the way Tom
harangued the country people, who came out into the
roads. From thence they went to a farm at Herne
Hill, where they received food, and then on to Dargate
Common. Here, by Tom's orders, all prayed. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
this they proceeded to Bossenden Farm, where they
rested for the night in a barn.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on Tuesday morning they went to
Sittingbourne, and there Tom provided them with
breakfast, for which he paid twenty-seven shillings.
Thence they marched to Newnham, where, at the
George Inn, they received a similar treat. What they
went marching for not one of these deluded men seemed
to know, unless it were to gather recruits; and in
this he was successful. Wherever he went&mdash;at Eastling,
Throwley, Sildswick, Lees, and Selling&mdash;he delivered
speeches, made promises, and obtained adherents.
Then the whole party returned to Bossenden
Farm. Here there was an extensive wood, in which the
true Canterbury bell is found. The district is called
the Blean, and here a condition of affairs existed that
greatly helped on the cause of Tom. In the eighteenth
century much of the Blean was taken possession of by
a number of squatters, who settled on the ground,
then extra-parochial, as a "free port," from which none
could dislodge them, and there they remained paying
rent to none. Now the poor deluded peasants of the
neighbourhood conceived the idea that Tom, or
Courtenay, as he had called himself, was the promised
Messiah who was come to give to them all lands to be
their own, on which each man might sit under his own
vine, and that the rich and large-landed proprietors
would be cast out and consumed by the breath of his
mouth.</p>

<p>During the tramp of these enthusiasts about the
country, a farmer named Curling lost some of his
labourers, who were enticed away from their work to
follow with the rest. Curling at once mounted his
horse and went to a magistrate, and procured from him
a warrant for the apprehension of Courtenay <i>alias</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
Tom. Nicholas Meares, a constable, and his brother
were entrusted to execute the warrant; and on Thursday
morning, 31st May, about six o'clock, they hastened to
Culver's farm to secure the men. Upon their presenting
themselves, Courtenay stood forward, and before
Meares could read the warrant shot him dead. He then
went into the house, exclaiming to those who were
there, "Now am I not your Saviour?" and then issuing
from the house again, he discharged a second pistol
into the body of Meares, and proceeded to mutilate it
barbarously with his sword.</p>

<p>The news of this murder was conveyed to the magistrates,
and they proceeded to take steps for the apprehension
of Courtenay. But the latter at once called
out his men, and they marched into Bossenden Wood,
and there profanely he imitated the Last Supper and
administered to his dupes in bread and water. This
over, a man named Alexander Foad knelt down in
the presence of the rest and worshipped him as his
Saviour, and demanded whether he were required to
follow him in body, or whether he might be allowed to
return to his home and follow him in spirit. Courtenay
replied, "In the body"; whereupon Foad sprang to his
feet, exclaiming, "Oh! be joyful, be joyful! the
Saviour has accepted me. Now go on; I will follow
till I drop."</p>

<p>Another man, named Blanchard, also worshipped
him, and Courtenay then said, in reference to the murder
of Meares, "I was executing the justice of Heaven in
consequence of the power that God has given me."</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock Tom and his followers shifted
their position to an osier-bed, and there he harangued
them, informing them that he and all such as believed
in him would be invulnerable. He defied the magistrates
and all the power of the world: his was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
Kingdom of Heaven; and then he advised his followers
to take up a position in ambush in the wood. At this
time Tom noticed that a Mr. Handley, of Herne Hill,
was observing their actions, and Courtenay <i>alias</i> Tom
fired at him; but he was beyond the range, and he
happily missed his aim.</p>

AS HE APPEARED AT THE ELECTION IN 1832</p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the magistrates had taken steps to
put an end to this fiasco. They had despatched a
messenger to Canterbury to summon the military, and
a detachment of a hundred men of the 45th Foot, under
the command of Major Armstrong, was placed at their
disposal, and marched to Boughton. As the party of
Courtenay was in the wood, the magistrates and the
soldiery and the constables marched thither. The
wood is of very considerable extent, but was intersected
by the main road from London and Chatham to Canterbury,
which was cut across by another road, a parish
road, at right angles. It was found that the insurgent
party was so placed that their front and rear were
covered by the roads right and left. The military were
in consequence divided; and whilst one party of fifty
took the road leading to Canterbury, under the command
of Captain Reed, the other was conducted by
Major Armstrong, assisted by Lieutenants Bennett and
Prendergast, along the road that led to Boulton-under-Blean.
Thus the insurgents were placed between two
bodies of troops, and their only chance of escape was to
retreat in a straight line through the wood. But Tom
<i>alias</i> Courtenay had no intention of retiring, and he
boldly faced Major Armstrong with the men behind
him drawn up, armed with picks and reaping-hooks.
He was summoned to surrender, but turned and bade
his followers be of good cheer and prepare for conflict.
These numbered from thirty to forty men. Courtenay
gave the order to charge, and advanced on the soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
when Lieutenant Bennett drew his sword and, heading
the military, ran forward, and was shot by Courtenay;
the ball, entering his right side, passed completely
through the body of the young officer, who reeled and
fell dead on the spot. At this moment a constable
named Millwood sprang forward and felled Tom, but
as the madman rose to his feet again, he was struck by
a ball from the military, for they had received orders to
fire from Major Armstrong, who was on horseback. By
the discharge eight men were killed on the spot and
several were wounded; but the wretched peasantry
fought desperately, till at last dispersed by the charge
of the soldiers under Armstrong, and those under
Captain Reed taking them in flank, when they scattered
and fled through the wood.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon twenty-seven prisoners
were taken, of whom seven were suffering from wounds,
two of whom died shortly after.</p>

<p>Of the party employed in maintaining the law,
George Catt, a constable, was shot under a mistaken
apprehension that he was one of the rioters; and Lieutenant
Prendergast received a contused wound on the
head from the bludgeon of an insurgent.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the week the coroner was
engaged in conducting the necessary inquiries into the
cause of death of the deceased persons. Verdicts of
"Wilful murder" were returned in the cases of the
constable Meares, and of Lieutenant Bennett, against
Courtenay and his adherents; whilst in the case of
Catt, the jury found "That he had been killed upon an
erroneous belief that he was a rioter."</p>

<p>In the cases of death among the insurgents, the jury
found a verdict of "Justifiable homicide."</p>

<p>The coroner conducted the investigations at the Red
Lion Inn, Boughton, where the yard was full of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
wives, widows, and children of these deluded men;
whilst the wounded lay on stretchers, as also the bodies
of the slain, in a stable; the prisoners were in a lockup,
whence they were brought handcuffed to the tavern
to be examined. During the sitting of the jury, two
of the wounded men died, and upon their decease
being communicated to those outside, they gave
vent to their feelings in loud wails. The body of
Lieutenant Bennett lay in an upper chamber of the
inn. He was but about twenty-five years of age, and
had just obtained leave of absence when the news of
the outbreak reached the barracks, whereupon he
applied and obtained permission to join the party. At
the conclusion of the proceedings before the coroner
and the magistrates nineteen prisoners were committed
for trial. Ten of the rioters had been killed. Out of
the prisoners, Meares, a cousin of the murdered constable,
Foad, and Couchworth were wounded. Foad
was a respectable farmer, cultivating about sixty acres.
A woman, Sarah Culver, was kinswoman of the farmer
who had first sent to the magistrates. She was possessed
of considerable property, and was forty years of
age. She had been a devoted follower of Courtenay;
but it may be presumed that she, like him, was insane.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 5th June, the greater number of those
who had been killed in the riot were interred in the
churchyard of Herne Hill. Amongst these was Tom.
Great crowds attended, amongst them his adherents,
who were in expectation that he would rise again and
confound his enemies. Some apprehensions were entertained
lest the mob should use violence to prevent the
burial of their late fanatical leader, but the whole affair
passed off quietly.</p>

<p>At the Maidstone Assizes on Thursday, the 9th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
August, 1838, the trial of the prisoners commenced
before Lord Denman.</p>

<p>Ten of the prisoners were found guilty of murder and
were condemned to death, but were informed that the
sentence would be commuted, and their lives be spared.
The prosecutions in the cases of the other prisoners
were not proceeded with, and they were discharged.</p>

<p>From the admissions of the prisoners, it was ascertained
that Courtenay had promised his followers on
the following Sunday to lead them to Canterbury, to
set fire to the city and to have "a glorious but a bloody
day."</p>

<p>Tom had assured his adherents that death had no
power over him; that even though he might
seem to die he would rise again in a month, if a little
water were applied to his lips. Accordingly, for a
considerable time after he was buried, the ignorant
people waited in lively expectation that he would reappear.</p>

<p>Of the prisoners, Meares and Wills were ordered to be
transported for life; Price for ten years. The other
seven were to undergo one year's imprisonment with
hard labour. A pension of £40 per annum was granted
to the widow of Meares the constable.</p>

<p>Good comes out of evil, and one result of this lamentable
affair was that attention was drawn to the abysmal
ignorance of the peasantry of the Blean, and that schools
were at once erected at Dunkirk, to introduce a better
knowledge and sense into the heads of the rising
generation.</p>

<p>A full account of the whole affair was published at
Faversham directly after the event, of which this is the
title: "An account of the desperate affray which took
place in Blean Wood, near Boughton, Thursday, 31st
May, 1838, between a party of agricultural labourers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
headed by the self-styled Sir William Courtenay, and a
detachment of the 45th Regiment of Foot, commanded
by Major Elliott Armstrong, acting under the orders of
the County Magistrates, together with the whole of the
evidence taken before T. T. Delasaux, Esq., coroner,
the Rev. Dr. Bow, N. J. Knatchbull, Esq., and W. C.
Fairman, Esq., drawn from authentic documents.
With an account of the funerals of the parties."</p>

<p>There is another work, a copy of which is now in the
British Museum, and is illustrated with a portrait of
Tom, a plate representing the murder of Meares,
soldiers entering Bossenden Wood; the scene of action,
the "Red Lion," where the bodies lay; the interior of
the stable with six of the bodies; Sir William Courtenay
as he appeared after the post-mortem examination, and

<h2>THE BOHELLAND TRAGEDY</h2>


<p>In the parish of Gluvias by Penryn is Bohelland.
Fifty years ago there was a ruin here of a roofless
house, with the gables standing. Now all that
remains is a fragment of wall. Tradition regarding
the field in which the house stood is, that it
invariably brings ill luck to him who owns or rents it.
The way from Penryn to Enys, a lane, leads by it, and
the fragment of wall abuts on the lane. Bohelland is
not marked on the one-inch, but is on the six-inch
ordnance map. Anciently it was called the Behethlan,
and Gluvias Church was called Capella de Behethlan
under S. Budock.</p>

<p>In the possession of J. D. Enys, Esq., of Enys, is a
MS. pedigree of the family to whom Bohelland belonged.
It runs as follows: "John Behethlan was
seized of lands <i>in agro Behethlan</i>, and had issue two
daughters, Margery and Joan, and the said Margery
took to husband Roger Polwheyrell, and had issue
Nicholas Polwheyrell; the said Nicholas Polwheyrell
had issue James Polwheyrell; the said James Polwheyrell
had issue Richard, Margery, Joan and Isabel,
and the said Richard married Maud Polgiau, and they
had issue Nichola, and the said Nichola took to husband
John Penweyre, and had issue Thomas Penweyre,
who died without heirs. The said Margery took to
husband Symon Martharwyler, and had issue Elsota
and Meliora. The said Elsota took to husband
Nicholas Mantle, now living, and had issue Isabel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
who took to husband John Restaden, now living.
The said Meliora took to husband Michael John,
vicar,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and had issue Joan, Elizabeth, and Margaret.</p>

<p>"The said Joan took to husband Hugh Sandre, now
living. The said Elizabeth took to husband Laurence
Michell, now living; the said Margaret took to husband
James Curallak, now living. The said Joan,
second daughter of the said James Polwheyrell, took
to husband John Trelecoeth, and had issue Marina and
Joan. The said Isabel, third daughter of the said
James, took to husband William son of John Tryarne,
and died without issue."</p>

<p>Unfortunately this pedigree does not contain a single
date, but we should obtain one approximately by the
marriage of Meliora, daughter of Simon Martharwyla,
with Michael John, vicar, if we could trace him. With
her descended the inheritance of Behethlan to her
daughter Joan who married Hugh Sandry.</p>

<p>The story of the Bohelland or Behethlan tragedy is
contained in a pamphlet of eight leaves, black letter,
and accompanied by rude woodcuts, entitled <i>News
from Penrin, in Cornwall, 1618</i>. A unique copy is in
the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>Sanderson, in his <i>Annals of King James</i>, 1656, gives
the same story. Sir William Sanderson says that
"the imprinted relation conceals the names, in favour
of some neighbours of repute and kin to the family,"
and that "the same sense made him thereon silent
also."</p>

<p>Now, according to the story, there were four deaths,
one a murder, and two by suicide, and one might
expect to obtain these names from the parish register.
But this register, which goes back into the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
the sixteenth century, has the page or pages removed
for the burials of 1618; that is to say, from the first
days of 1618 to the middle of 1621. This looks much
as if the family sought to destroy every trace of the
crime.</p>

<p>Hals, in his MS. <i>History of Cornwall</i>, under the head
of Gluvias, does not mention Bohelland. There is no
help to be obtained from the title deeds of the estate.
Our sole clue is the descent in the pedigree. Meliora,
who married Michael John, vicar, cannot have done
this before the reign of Edward VI, and it is not probable
that the marriage took place till that of Elizabeth.
They were not married at Gluvias, and Michael John
was not the vicar then. Now the pedigree carries down
the descent, with possession of Bohelland to John
Restadon and his wife Isabel. The name Restadon
does not occur in the Visitations of Cornwall. The
only other possible owner would be Hugh Sandry and
his wife Joan, daughter of the vicar, Michael John.
But whether it were either the Sandrys or the
Restadons, or some one else, cannot be determined
till further light enters on this extremely dark occurrence.</p>

<p>The owner of Bohelland was a man of some consideration
and substance, "unhappy only in a younger
son, who taking liberty from his father's bounty, with
a crew of like condition, that wearied on land, they
went roving to sea, and in a small vessel southward,
took booty from all they could master, and so increasing
force and wealth, ventured in a Turk's man
in the Streights; but by mischance their own powder
fired themselves, and our gallant, trusting to his skilful
swimming, got on shore upon Rhodes with the best
of his jewels about him; when, offering some to sale
to a Jew, who knew them to be the Governor's of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
Algier, he was apprehended, and as a pirate sentenced
to the gallies among other Christians, when miserable
slavery made them all studious of freedom, and
with wit and valour, took opportunity and means to
murther some officers, got on board of an English ship,
and came safe to London, where his misery and some
skill made him servant to a surgeon and sudden preferment
to the East Indies. There by this means he
got money, with which, returning back, he designed
himself for his native county, Cornwall. And in a
small ship from London, sailing to the west, was cast
away upon that coast. But his excellent skill in
swimming and former fate to boot, brought him safe
to shore, where, since his fifteen years' absence, his
father's former fortunes much decayed, now retired
him not far off to a country habitation, in debt and
danger.</p>

<p>"His sister he finds married to a mercer, a meaner
match than her birth promised. To her at first he
appears a poor stranger, but in private reveals himself,
and withall what jewels and gold he had concealed
in a bow-case about him, and concluded that
the next day he intended to appear to his parents, and
to keep his disguise till she and her husband should
meet, and make their common joy complete.</p>

<p>"Being come to his parents, his humble behaviour,
suitable to his suit of clothes, melted the old couple
to so much compassion as to give him covering from
the cold season under their outward roof, and by
degrees his travelling tales, told with passion to the
aged people, made him their guest so long by the
kitchen fire, that the husband took his leave and went
to bed, and soon after, his true stories working compassion
in the weaker vessel, she wept, and so did he;
but, compassionate of her tears, he comforted her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
a piece of gold, which gave assurance that he deserved
a lodging, to which she brought him; and, being in
bed, showed her his girdled wealth, which he said was
sufficient to relieve her husband's wants, and to spare
for himself, and being very weary, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>"The wife, tempted with the golden bait of what
she had, and eager of enjoying all, awakened her
husband with this news, and her contrivance what to
do; and though with horrid apprehensions he oft refused,
yet her puling fondness (Eve's enchantments)
moved him to consent, and rise to be master of all,
and both of them to murder the man, which instantly
they did, covering the corpse under the clothes till
opportunity to convey it out of the way.</p>

<p>"The early morning hastens the sister to her father's
house, when she, with signs of joy, enquires for a sailor
that should lodge there the last night. The parents
slightly denied to have seen such, until she told them
that he was her brother, her lost brother. By that
assured scar upon his arm, cut with a sword in his
youth, she knew him, and were all resolved this morning
to meet there and be merry.</p>

<p>"The father hastily runs up, finds the mark, and
with horrid regret of this monstrous murder of his
own son, with the same knife cuts his own throat.</p>

<p>"The wife went up to consult with him, when in a
most strange manner beholding them both in blood,
and aghast, with the instrument at hand, readily rips
herself up, and perishes on the same spot.</p>

<p>"The daughter, doubting the delay of their absence,
searches for them all, whom she found out too soon,
and with the sad sight of this scene, and being overcome
with horror and amaze of this deluge of destruction,
she sank down and died; the fatal end of that
family."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several points in this narrative that awaken
mistrust. How is the story of the son's life known?
He tells it to his sister, but she dies. Then we have
an account of what went on in the house between the
parents and the son, and the wife urging her husband
to commit the murder. As both killed themselves on
discovering what they had done, all this part must be
painted in by guesswork.</p>

<p>That there is a substratum of fact cannot be doubted.
The mysterious mutilation of the parish register for
the year of the murder indicates a desire that the names
might not be known.</p>

<p>Lillo turned the story into a tragedy, <i>The Fatal
Curiosity</i>, 1736. According to him the name of the
family was Wilmot. He took a slight liberty with
the story, in that he made the returned sailor present
himself to the girl he had loved fifteen years before,
and not to his sister. But he laid the scene at Penryn.</p>

<h2>MARY KELYNACK</h2>


<p>The Kelynack family has been one of fishermen
and seamen at Newlyn and its neighbourhood
for many generations.</p>

<p>Philip Kelynack was the first to fly to the
rescue of John Wesley when pursued by a mob while
preaching on the Green between Newlyn and Penzance
12th July, 1747. He was a remarkably powerful man,
and was known by the name of Old Bunger. His son
Charles was the first to engage the Mount's Bay boatmen
to take part in the Irish Sea fishing in 1720.</p>

<p>Mary, the subject of this notice, was the daughter
of Nicholas Tresize and the wife of William Kelynack.
She was born at Tolcarne, in Madron, 1766.</p>

<p>In 1851 was the Great Exhibition in London, and the
tidings of opening of a Crystal Palace and the wonders
that it contained reached to the extremity of Cornwall.
Said Mary Kelynack, "I'll go and see'n too, I
reckon!" and away she trudged.</p>

<p>The <i>Illustrated London News</i> for October 26th, 1851,
gives the following account of her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On Tuesday, September 24th, among the visitors
of the Mansion House was Mary Callinack, eighty-four
years of age, who had travelled on foot from Penzance,
carrying a basket on her head, with the object of visiting
the Exhibition and of paying her respects personally to
the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress. As soon as the
ordinary business was finished the aged woman entered
the justice-room, when the Lord Mayor, addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
her, said, 'Well, I understand, Mrs. Callinack, you
have come to see me?'</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_744.png" id="i_744.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_744.png" alt="MARY KELYNACK" title="MARY KELYNACK" />
   <p class="caption2">MARY KELYNACK</p>
</div>

<p>"She replied, 'Yes, God bless you. I never was in
such a place before as this. I have come up asking for
a small sum of money, I am, sir.'</p>

<p>"The Lord Mayor: 'Where do you come from?'</p>

<p>"Mrs. C.: 'From the Land's End.'</p>

<p>"The Lord Mayor: 'From what part?'</p>

<p>"Mrs. C.: 'Penzance.'</p>

<p>"She then stated that she left Penzance five weeks
ago, and had been the whole of that time walking to
the metropolis.</p>

<p>"The Lord Mayor: 'What induced you to come to
London?'</p>

<p>"Mrs. C.: 'I had a little matter to attend to as well
as to see the Exhibition. I was there yesterday, and
mean to go again to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"The Lord Mayor: 'What do you think of it?'</p>

<p>"Mrs. C.: 'I think it very good.'"</p>

<p>She then said that all her money was spent but 5-1/2d.
After a little further conversation, which caused considerable
merriment, the Lord Mayor made her a
present of a sovereign, telling her to take care of it,
there being a good many thieves in London. The
poor creature, on receiving the gift, burst into tears
and said, "Now I will be able to get back."</p>

<p>She was afterwards received by the Lady Mayoress,
with whom she remained some time, and having partaken
of tea in the housekeeper's room, which she said
she preferred to the choicest wine in the kingdom
(which latter beverage she had not tasted for sixty
years), she returned thanks for the hospitality she had
received and left the Mansion House.</p>

<p>Her next visit was to the Exhibition.</p>

<p>She was also presented to the Queen and to Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
Albert, and there is mention of this presentation in
Sir Theodore Martin's <i>Life of the Prince Consort</i> (1876),
II, p. 405.</p>

<p>In the notice in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> it is
said: "Our portrait of the Cornish fish-wife has been
sketched from life at her abode, Homer Place, Crawford
Street, Mary-le-bone. She was born in the parish of
Paul, by Penzance, on Christmas Day, 1766, so that
she has nearly completed her eighty-fifth year. To
visit the present Exhibition, she walked the entire
distance from Penzance, nearly three hundred miles;
she having 'registered a vow' before she left home,
that she would not accept assistance in any shape,
except as regarded her finances. She possesses her
faculties unimpaired; is very cheerful, has a considerable
amount of humour in her composition; and is
withal a woman of strong common sense, and frequently
makes remarks that are very shrewd, when her
great age and defective education are taken into
account. She is fully aware that she has made herself
somewhat famous; and among other things which she
contemplates, is her return to Cornwall, to end her days
in 'Paul parish,' where she wishes to be interred by the
side of old Dolly Pentreath, who was also a native
of Paul, and died at the age of 102 years."</p>

<p>Mary Kelynack died in Dock Lane, Penzance, 5th
December, 1855, and was buried in S. Mary's churchyard.</p>

<p>Messrs. Routledge published the story of her walk
to London and back in one of <i>Aunt Mavor's Storybooks</i>,
with illustrations.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN WILLIAM ROGERS</h2>


<p>Captain William Rogers, son of
Captain Rogers, who died in November,
1790, was born at Falmouth, 29th September,
1783. He married Susan, daughter of Captain
John Harris, of S. Mawes. In 1807, Rogers was
master, in temporary command of the <i>Windsor Castle</i>,
a packet-boat from Falmouth to Barbados. She
mounted six long 4-pounders and two 9-pounder carronades,
with a complement of twenty-eight men and
boys.</p>

<p>On October 1st, 1807, as the packet was on her
passage to Barbados with the mails, a privateer
schooner was seen approaching under all sail.</p>

<p>As it seemed quite impossible to escape, Captain
Rogers resolved on making a stout resistance, though
the odds against him were great. In fact, the privateer
mounted six long 6-pounders and one long 18-pounder,
with a complement of ninety-two men.</p>

<p>At noon the schooner got within gunshot, hoisted
French colours, and opened fire, which was immediately
returned from the chase-guns of the <i>Windsor Castle</i>.
This was continued till the privateer, whose name
was <i>Le Jeune Richard</i>, came near, when she hailed the
packet in very opprobrious terms, and desired her to
strike her colours. On meeting with a prompt refusal,
the schooner ran alongside, grappled the packet, and
attempted to board. But the crew of the <i>Windsor
Castle</i> made so stout a resistance with their pikes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
the French were obliged to abandon the attempt with
the loss of ten killed and wounded. The privateer,
finding she had a hard nut to crack, lost heart, and
sought to cut away the grapplings and get clear; but
the packet's mainyard, being locked in the schooner's
rigging, held her fast.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers evinced great judgment and zeal in
ordering some of his men to shift the sails as circumstances
required, or to cut them away in the event of
the privateer succeeding in the conflict.</p>

<p>At about 3 p.m. one of the packet's guns, a 1-pounder
carronade, loaded with double grape, canister
and a hundred musket balls, was brought to bear on the
deck of the privateer, and was discharged at the
moment when a fresh boarding party was collected for
a second attempt. The result was a frightful slaughter,
and as the French reeled under this discharge, Captain
Rogers, followed by the men of his little crew, leaped
upon the deck of the schooner, and notwithstanding
the apparently overwhelming odds against him, succeeded
in driving the privateer's men from their
quarters, and ultimately in capturing the vessel.</p>

<p>Of the crew of the <i>Windsor Castle</i> three had been
killed and two severely wounded; but of that of <i>Le
Jeune Richard</i> there were twenty-one dead upon the
deck, and thirty-three were wounded.</p>

<p>From the very superior number of the privateer's crew
still remaining&mdash;thirty-eight men&mdash;whereas Captain
Rogers had only fifteen available, great precautions had
to be taken in securing the prisoners. They were
accordingly ordered up from below, one by one, and
each put in irons. Any attempt at a rescue being thus
effectually guarded against, the packet proceeded, with
her prize, to the port of her destination, which fortunately
for the former was not far distant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_750.png" id="i_750.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_750.png" alt="CAPTAIN W. ROGERS" title="CAPTAIN W. ROGERS" />
   <p class="caption2">CAPTAIN W. ROGERS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span></p>

<p>This achievement reflected the highest honour upon
every officer, man, and boy that was on board the
<i>Windsor Castle</i>, but especially on Captain Rogers. Had
he stayed to calculate the chances that were against him,
the probability is that the privateer would have
ultimately succeeded in capturing the packet, whose
light carronades could have offered very little resistance
at the usual distance at which vessels engage;
and where any small crew, without such a <i>coup de
main</i>&mdash;indeed, without such a leader&mdash;could never have
brought the combat to a favourable issue.</p>

<p>For his intrepid conduct Rogers received the thanks
of H.M. Postmaster-General; promotion to the rank of
captain, with command of another packet, 100 guineas
besides his share of the prize (although no prize allowance
was usual); the freedom of the City of London;
and an illuminated address, with a sword of honour,
from the inhabitants of Tortola.</p>

<p>In London, a gentleman named Dixon, unacquainted
with Rogers, sought and obtained his friendship, and
then commissioned Samuel Drummond to make a
picture of the action, in which the hero's full-length
portrait should appear. Whilst the painting was in
progress, one day Rogers ran up against a man in the
street so closely resembling the officer he had shot,
that he held him by the button and begged as a
favour that he would allow a distinguished artist to
paint his portrait. The gentleman was not a little
surprised, but when Rogers informed him who he was
and why he desired to have him painted, he readily
consented. He was conducted to the studio, and there
stood as portrait-model for the French swordsman by
whom Rogers had been so nearly cut down. When
completed, the painting was retained by Mr. Dixon,
but it was engraved in mezzotint by Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span></p>

<p>The painting in course of time passed to the first
owner's grandson, Mr. James Dixon, whose daughter
at his decease in 1896 became possessed of it, and
presented it to the nation, and it is now in the Painted
Hall at Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers died at Holyhead January 11, 1825.
His and his wife's portraits were preserved by her
relatives, and eventually given to the only surviving
daughter or her descendants.</p>

<p>In Johns and Nicolas's <i>Calendar of Victory</i>, 1855, is
an account of this sea-fight; also in the <i>European
Magazine</i> of 1808, with a portrait of the gallant captain.
Also in James's <i>Naval History of Great Britain</i>
(1820), Vol. IV.</p>

<p>Rogers's own account, condensed, is to be found in a
paper by Rev. W. Jago, "The Heroes of the Old
Falmouth Packet Service," in the <i>Journal of the Royal
Institution of Cornwall</i>, XIII, 1895-8.</p>

<h2>JOHN BURTON, OF FALMOUTH</h2>


<p>Joseph Burton, of Stockport, Lancashire,
came, for what reason is unknown, to Cornwall
in 1830, and set up a china and glass shop at
Bodmin; and married at Launceston a Miss
Clemo.</p>

<p>Old Joseph was a sturdy Radical and Nonconformist.
He was a vigorous and loud supporter of the Ballot
Society, the Liberation Society, and the United Kingdom
Alliance. He was also a vehement and "intemperate"
teetotaler. He died at Bodmin 19th July, 1876. John
was one of a whole string of children, and as the
"cloam" shop did not bring in a large profit, and John
was one among many, he had to go into life very
inefficiently equipped with education. But he had inherited
from his father a masterful spirit, and had his
own independent views, and it was soon a case between
them of flint and steel, and sparks flew out.</p>

<p>John and his brother Joe were sent round the country
hawking pots and glass.</p>

<p>"I well remember the 24th December, 1853," said
John Burton. "Myself and brother Joe (who afterwards
became a well-known auctioneer) rose at five o'clock in
the morning, fed the horse, and made a start at 5.45 a.m.
with a wagon-load of goods. The morning was dark,
and when we came to Callywith turnpike gate it was
closed. We knocked Henry Mark, the toll-keeper, up
to let us through. He looked out of the window and at
first refused to let us pass until daylight. We firmly told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
him that we would certainly unhang the gate and pass
through without paying the toll. This fetched the old
man down, with his long coat, knitted night-cap, with
horn lantern in his hand. He opened the gate and told
us, 'You Burtons ought to be poisoned for breaking a
man's rest.' A lot we cared for his curses. Fairly on
the road, we were as happy as sandboys. Having
delivered the goods, and fairly on the way home, we
stopped at the Jamaica Inn, where the old mail-coaches
used to change their horses, to feed our horse, not
forgetting ourselves. After giving old Dapper his feed
of oats, we went into the inn kitchen, where we ordered
a hot meal. The landlady asked, 'What would you
like?' She suggested a hot squab pie, which she took
out of a huge kitchen range well loaded with burning
turf, the odour of which increased our appetite considerably.
We polished off the pie and pocketed the crust
to eat on the moors when homeward bound."</p>

<p>The Jamaica Inn is in the midst of the Bodmin Moors.
In the time of the mail-coaches from London by Exeter
to Falmouth it was a house of great repute. But when
the trains ran, and coaches were given up, it fell from
its high estate, was converted into a temperance house,
was far from clean, harboured innumerable fleas, and
did little business. Of late it has entirely recovered
its credit. It stands nine hundred feet above the sea.
There are now there at Bolventor a church and a school.
A bleak, wind-swept moor all about it. Dozmare Pool,
haunted by Tregeagle, is near by&mdash;and in June the
meadows around are a sheet of gold from the buttercups.
But to return to John Burton's reminiscences.</p>

<p>"When the landlady came in and saw that we had
finished the pie, she looked with amazement towards us.</p>

<p>"'Why, drat you boys, whativer have 'ee done with
the pie?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Why, ate'n, missus. Do'y think us called the
horse in to help us, or what?'</p>

<p>"'No,' she smartly replied, 'I should 'a thawt you
had the Bodmunt Murlicha (Militia) here to help 'ee
out. I never seed such gluttons in my life.'</p>

<p>"When we asked what we had got to pay, she said,
'Sixpunce for the crist, threepunce for the suitt, ninepunce
for the gibblets, and eightpunce for apples,
onions, spice, currants and sugar, and fourpunce for
baking 'un; two dishes of tay, tuppunce; that'll be two
and eightpunce altogether, boys.'</p>

<p>"'All right, missus, here's the posh.'</p>

<p>"She asked us out of bravado if we could eat any
more. We said, 'Yes, we could do with some Christmas
cake.'</p>

<p>"She politely told us that she shouldn't cut the
Christmas cake until the next day. 'But you can have
some zeedy biscays, if you like.'</p>

<p>"'All right.' And in she brought them, which we
also polished off. Afterwards she demanded fourpence
for them.</p>

<p>"'All right, missus, the fourpunce charged for
baking the pie will pay for the biscuits, so us'll cry
quits,' which joke the old woman swallowed with a
good laugh."</p>

<p>John Burton proceeds to describe the Christmas
merry-making at the inn that night. Jamaica Inn had
not then become a temperance hotel. The moormen
and farmers came in, the great fire glowed like a
furnace. The wind sobbed without, and piped in at
the casement&mdash;"the souls on the wind," as it was said,
the spirits of unbaptized babes wailing at the windowpane,
seeing the fire within, and condemned to wander
on the cold blast without.</p>

<p>To the red fire, and to the plentiful libations, songs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
were sung, among others that very favourite ballad of
the "Highwayman"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I went to London both blythe and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My time I squandered in dice and play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until my funds they fell full low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the highway I was forced to go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then after an account of how he robbed Lord Mansfield
and Lady Golding, of Portman Square&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I shut the door, bade all good night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rambled to my heart's delight.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a career of riot and robbery, the Highwayman
at length falls into the toils of Sir John Fielding, who
was the first magistrate to take sharp and decisive
measures against these pests of society. Then the
ballad ends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I am dead, borne to my grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gallant funeral may I have;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six highwaymen to carry me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With good broadswords and sweet liberty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Six blooming maidens to bear my pall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give them white gloves and pink ribbons all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I'm dead they'll say the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a wild and a wicked youth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the local characters who was present on that
Christmas Eve was Billy Peppermint. As he was overcome
with drink, the young Burtons conveyed him
from the Jamaica Inn about ten miles, and then turned
him out of their conveyance, and propped him up
against the railings of a house in Bodmin, as he was
quite unable to sustain himself.</p>

<p>That night the carol singers were making their
round, and as they came near they piped forth:
"When shepherds watched their flocks by night, all
seated on the ground, an angel of the Lord appeared,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereon Billy roared forth&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I am dead they'll say the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a wild and a wicked youth,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and rolled over and fell prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p>In 1857 an event occurred which altered the direction
of John Burton's activities.</p>

<p>He had been sent along with one of his father's
hawkers named Paul Mewton with a crate of china on
his head to S. Columb. On their way they called
at Porth, and there Paul complained that he was not
well, whereupon a Mr. Stephens, with whom they were
doing business, produced a case of spirits and gave
first Paul and then John Burton each a glass of very
strong grog. Paul could stand it, but not so John,
and as he was carrying his basket of "cloam" over a
stile he lost his balance, and away went the crate and
all its contents, which were shivered to atoms.</p>

<p>This was too much for Mr. Joseph Burton, a rigid
teetotaler, and he had words with his son on the immorality
of touching fermented liquor, and above all
on the consequences of a loss of many shillings' worth
of china.</p>

<p>The stile is still to be seen. On one side is inscribed,
"Burton's Stile, 1857"; on the other is a carving of a
gin-bottle, a water-jug, and a glass, with the legend
beneath, "The Fall of Man."</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a series of altercations
between John and his father, which led at last to John
abandoning his parent, and in 1862 he set up in Falmouth
on his own account with thirty shillings in his
pocket. As Burton was wont to say of the world into
which he had entered on his own account&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis a very good world for to live in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lend, or to spend, or to give in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to beg or to borrow, or get a man's own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the very worst world that ever was known.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span></p>
<p>For some time he earned a living by hawking
crockery about in Falmouth. Then, some sailors
coming into the harbour brought with them some
alligators. Burton spent his money on buying them,
and then started out in quest of various herbalists, and
disposed of the reptiles to them. A stuffed alligator
hanging up in a shop was an object imposing on the
imagination of patients.</p>

<p>In 1865 a number of Roman coins were found at
Pennance Farm, in S. Budock, and Burton bought
these, and then became an antiquary. At this time
numerous vessels put in at Falmouth, and the sailors
had brought with them parrots, apes, and all sorts of
curiosities from foreign parts, and were prepared to sell
them for very small sums. Burton bought as far as his
profits would allow, and thus he became a curiosity
dealer. He secured business premises in Market
Street, and began to store them with odds and ends of
every description. He rambled about in Cornwall,
and his keen eye detected at once a bit of old china, a
scrap of carved oak, an odd signboard, a piece of
Chippendale furniture, a framed sampler, and he
bought everywhere, and stocked his premises. As his
business grew he advertised extensively, and gradually
but surely built up an extensive business. In curiosities
he became a very Whiteley. Any one who desired anything
peculiar could apply to John Burton, and John
Burton would supply it, if not a genuine antique, yet
"made to order," and indistinguishable from an
antique. When there began to be a run on Bristol
lustre ware, he was ready with a stock, which went off
rapidly. He bought old muskets by the thousand,
and sent them abroad to arm savage nations in Africa
and Asia.</p>

<p>One day a Scotchman entered his shop and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
to Burton, "I am looking out for a man who can sell
me three sixpences for a shilling."</p>

<p>"Then I am the man for you," said Burton, and
produced three defective sixpences.</p>

<p>"I'll have another shilling's worth," said the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"Ah! then I cannot accommodate you; but I can do
better&mdash;give you a bad shilling for a good one."</p>

<p>On one occasion the curator of the Edinburgh
Museum wrote down to him for the eleventh vertebra of
the skeleton of a whale that he had, but which was
wanting. By return of post Burton sent him up what
he needed.</p>

<p>He had a marvellous memory&mdash;remembering all the
multifarious items in his shop, though they were continually
changing.</p>

<p>When the new Eddystone Lighthouse was erected, he
wrote to Trinity House and offered £500 for Smeaton's
lighthouse that had been taken down. This roused a
storm of indignation in Plymouth, and ended in that
town securing it for £1600, to be erected on the Hoe.</p>

<p>The town of Penryn possessed its old stocks, bearing
date 1673. These he bought for £2, and sold
them to a Devizes antiquary for a large sum. Then he
purchased a haunted house&mdash;Trevethan Hall, in Falmouth&mdash;but
as the ghost could not be turned into
money, he pulled the house down and built on its site
Mount Edgcumbe Terrace.</p>

<p>During many years a stream of tourists, walking,
bicycling, motoring, has circulated round Cornwall,
starting from Bideford, careering to the Land's End,
and returning by the south coast to Plymouth, and
hardly a tourist thought of visiting Falmouth without
going to Burton's Curiosity Shop and making a purchase
there. Indeed, he and his shop were some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
sights of Cornwall. He had by nature great ready wit,
and a bluntness of manner which he cultivated, and
which gave poignancy to dealings with him. But his
bluntness, which was part of the stock-in-trade, was
not infrequently carried too far, and became impertinence.
He had a real love for his genuine curios, and
parted with them reluctantly; and this he allowed to
be seen. In this he was wholly unlike the ordinary
dealer who presses his wares on the hesitating purchaser.
When the present King, then Prince of
Wales, visited Falmouth in 1887, the Prince having a
cold sent Mr. Cavendish Bentinck to the Curiosity
Shop to request that Mr. Burton would send a collection
of what was most interesting in his shop for the
Prince's inspection. Upon this he addressed the
following letter to the Prince:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Respected Albert Edward.</span>&mdash;I much regret to
find you are indisposed. If I were to fetch to Kerrisvean
a Pickford's wagon-load of samples it would be utterly
impossible to convey the remotest idea of my ponderous
conglomeration of curios; but if I could prevail
upon Your Royal Highness to go through my shanty, I
would give you local wit and humour which would
throw you into a state of laughter, and there is every
probability it would counteract your cold.&mdash;Yours until
we meet in the next hotel,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">John Burton</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This, which he doubtless thought very smart, was
mere insolence. In fact, he had not a large store of
"local wit and humour," and mistook rudeness for fun.
But he was often encouraged in this. A lady once
entered his shop and said, "You've a rum lot of stuff
here, old boy; how much do you ask for that pair of
vases?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span></p>

<p>"Six guineas."</p>

<p>"I'll give you five, old fellow."</p>

<p>"Then, old girl, they are yours. Where shall I send
them, and to whom?"</p>

<p>"To the Duchess of &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg Your Grace's pardon; I have been too
familiar."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You treated me as I have treated you."</p>

<p>John Burton was an abstemious man, and believed
that by moderate diet and moderation in drinking he
would&mdash;and any man would&mdash;live to the age of a
hundred. He had framed for himself a code of rules
to ensure a long life.</p>

<p>1. Eight hours' sleep and that on your right side,
and sleep with the bedroom window open. Fresh air
is essential.</p>

<p>2. Do not have your bedstead against the wall, so
that the air may circulate about you freely.</p>

<p>3. Take a glass of hot water on rising, and a bath
at blood temperature, and take exercise before breakfast.</p>

<p>4. Eat little meat and see that it be well cooked, and
be careful to eat plenty of fat.</p>

<p>5. Take plenty of daily exercise in the open air.</p>

<p>6. Have no pet animals in your living-room.</p>

<p>7. Avoid tea&mdash;the tannin turns meat to leather and
spoils digestion, but take little or no intoxicant.</p>

<p>8. Keep guard against man's three enemies, the
three D's&mdash;Damp, Drains, and impure Drinking water.</p>

<p>9. Change of occupation, and frequent, if short,
holidays.</p>

<p>10. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>11. Keep your temper, and keep a cheery mind.</p>

<p>12. Limit your ambition to what you can do.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding these rules, John Burton did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
not live to a great age. He died of a painful internal
disease on May 28th, 1907. He had eight children by
his wife. One son, John, has a large earthenware
establishment in Falmouth; another&mdash;the image of his
father in face&mdash;carries on the "Old Curiosity Shop."</p>

<h2>THE FATE OF SIR CLOUDESLEY
SHOVEL</h2>


<p>The life of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, Knt. and
Admiral, must be given in few words, as his
association with Cornwall was in his death
and not in his birth and life.</p>

<p>He was born about the year 1650, of parents in
Norfolk in a humble condition of life, and he was made
a cobbler's apprentice, but, disliking this profession,
ran away to sea. He was at first a cabin-boy with
Sir Christopher Mynns; but, applying himself to the
study of navigation with indefatigable industry, his
skill as a seaman soon raised him above that station.
The corsairs of Tripoli had for long committed great
depredations on the English in the Mediterranean,
plundering and capturing merchant vessels and
carrying off the crews into slavery. Sir John Narborough
was sent in 1674 to reduce them to reason.
As he had received orders to try the effects of negotiation
before he proceeded to hostilities, he sent Mr. Shovel,
who was at that time a lieutenant in his fleet, to
demand satisfaction. The Dey treated him with disrespect,
and sent him back without an answer. Sir
John despatched him a second time, with orders to
observe the position of the piratical fleet in the
harbour. The behaviour of the Dey was as insolent
as possible. Upon Mr. Shovel's return he informed
Sir John that it would be possible, notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
batteries commanding the harbour, to cut out or burn
the ships therein, and he volunteered to command an
expedition in boats for the purpose. His offer was
accepted, and he managed to burn in the harbour,
under the castle and walls of Tripoli, the guard-ship and
four men-of-war belonging to the pirates of that place,
and to force the Dey to accept such conditions of peace
as Sir John Narborough was pleased to impose on him.</p>

<p>Sir John Narborough gave so favourable an account
of this exploit, that Shovel was soon after made captain
of the <i>Sapphire</i>, a fifth-rate ship.</p>

<p>In the skirmish of Bantry Bay, 1689, he was engaged,
and won such scanty laurels as the unworthy
Admiral Herbert allowed his fleet to deserve. James II
had his Court in Dublin. A French fleet, commanded
by the Count de Château-Renaud, had anchored in
Bantry Bay, and had put on shore a large quantity of
military stores and money. Herbert, who had been
sent to those seas with an English squadron for the
express purpose of intercepting the communications
between France and Ireland, sailed into the bay with
purpose of giving battle. But the wind was unfavourable,
and Herbert was without dash and energy, and was
a traitor at heart. After some trifling discharge of
gunpowder, which caused no serious loss of life on
either side, he deemed it prudent to stand out to sea,
and allow the French fleet to retire unmolested.</p>

<p>But according to Herbert's report, a great victory
had been gained by him, and the House of Commons,
believing what he stated, absurdly passed a vote of
thanks to him. We may well conceive the rage of
heart and scorn of his admiral that consumed Shovel
at the feeble attack and cowardly retreat. At the time
he was commander of the <i>Edgar</i>, and was soon after
knighted by King William.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">SIR CLOUDESLEY SHOVELL</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span></p>

<p>Next year he was employed in transporting an army
into Ireland, a service which he performed with such
diligence and dexterity that the King raised him to
the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue, and delivered
to him his commission with his own hands. Soon
after he was made Rear-Admiral of the Red, and
shared in the glory of the victory of La Hogue. In
1694 he bombarded Dunkirk.</p>

<p>In 1702 he was sent with a squadron of about twenty
men-of-war to join the Grand Fleet, and bring home
the galleons and other rich boats taken by the Duke of
Ormond and Sir George Rooke at Vigo.</p>

<p>The next year he was promoted to a higher post,
being appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate
Fleet in the Mediterranean, consisting of thirty-five
English and fourteen Dutch men-of-war. On
entering the Leghorn roads, the Governor refused to
accord a royal salute. Sir Cloudesley peremptorily
ordered the salute to be given, or to expect all the
guns of the fleet to ask the question why it had not
been at once accorded. The threat sufficed. In this
expedition Sir Cloudesley sent two men-of-war to endeavour
to supply the Camisards of the Cevennes with
money, arms, and ammunition, but failed to obtain
communication with them.</p>

<p>Soon after the battle off Malaga he was presented
by Prince George of Denmark to Queen Anne; she
received him graciously, and the next year employed
him as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1704, he had his share in the
honour of taking Gibraltar; and by his admirable
conduct, bravery, and success in the sea-fight that
happened soon after, between the Confederate and
French fleets, obliged the enemy's van to bear away
out of the reach of his cannon, and the Count of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
Toulouse to follow the example of his van, and escape
out of danger. Although in this action Sir Cloudesley
was second in command, yet he won the principal
credit for its success, and some months after was appointed
Rear-Admiral of England.</p>

<p>In 1705 he commanded the fleet, together with the
Earl of Portsmouth, which was sent into the Mediterranean,
and it was mainly owing to him that Barcelona
was taken.</p>

<p>After an unsuccessful attempt upon Toulon he sailed
for Gibraltar, and from thence on Michaelmas Day
homeward with a part of his fleet, consisting of fifteen
men-of-war, five of a lesser rank, and one yacht. He
was on the <i>Association</i>, Sir George Byng was commander
on the <i>Royal Arms</i>, Lord Dursley on the
<i>S. George</i>.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October Sir Cloudesley Shovel being
enveloped in fog, and taking soundings in ninety
fathoms, he brought to and lay by from noon till six
o'clock in the evening, when, as the wind freshened
and blew from the S.S.W., he made signal for sailing.
The fleet steered E. by N. and supposing that they had
the Channel open some of the ships ran upon the rocks
of Scilly, before they were aware, about eight o'clock
at night, and at once made signals of distress. The
<i>Association</i>, in which was Sir Cloudesley Shovel, struck
upon the rocks near the Bishop and his Clerks, and
went down with all hands on board.</p>

<p>The same fate befell the <i>Eagle</i> and the <i>Romney</i>. The
<i>Firebrand</i> was likewise dashed upon the rocks and
foundered; but the captain and four-and-twenty of his
men saved themselves in a boat. And Captain Sansom,
who commanded the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, being driven towards the
shore, was forced to abandon his ship to save his men.
The <i>Royal Arms</i> was saved by great presence of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
in both Sir George Byng and his officers and men, who
in a minute, on perceiving the rocks not a ship's length
to leeward, as well as those on which Sir Cloudesley
Shovel was lost, set her topsails and sheered off. Nor
had Lord Dursley, commanding the <i>S. George</i>, a less
fortunate escape; for his ship was dashed upon the
same reef as that on which the <i>Association</i> had been
wrecked; but the same wave that beat out the lights of
Sir Cloudesley's vessel lifted the <i>S. George</i> and floated
it away.</p>

<p>A story has remained deeply engraved in the
minds of the men of Scilly to the present day. It
is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 22nd October, that same fatal day, a sailor, a
native of Scilly, ventured to approach the admiral and
tell him that he was steering too far to the northward,
and that unless the course of the fleet was changed
they could not fail to run her upon the rocks. For this
act of insubordination Sir Cloudesley ordered the presumptuous
adviser to be hanged at the yard-arm of his
ship, the <i>Association</i>; and the only favour granted
him, in mitigation of his punishment, was a compliance
with the poor fellow's request that, before execution of
the sentence, he should be allowed to read a portion of
Scripture. The prayer granted, he read the 109th
Psalm in which occur the imprecations: "Let his
days be few; and let another take his office. Let
his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow....
Let his posterity be destroyed, and in the next
generation let his name be clean put out. Because his
mind was not to do good, but persecuted the poor,
helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at
the heart."</p>

<p>The report of this atrocious act could have been
communicated by only one man who was said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
escaped alive out of the crew of the <i>Association</i>. Now
happily we know that no man was saved out of that
vessel. The one man who was saved was George
Laurence, quartermaster of the <i>Romney</i>, a North-countryman
from near Hull, and a butcher by trade.
Of him we learn something from the account of Mr.
Edmund Herbert, Deputy Paymaster-General of the
Marine Regiments, who was in Scilly in 1709, sent
there with the object of trying to recover some of the
property lost in the wreck, which had taken place two
years before.</p>

<p>This fellow, says Herbert, was "a lusty fat man,
but much battered with the rocks. Most of the captains,
lieutenants, doctors, etc., of the squadron came
on shore and asked him many questions in relation to
the wreck, but not one man took pity on him, either to
dress or order to be dressed his bruises, etc., whereof
he had perished had not Mr. Ekins, a gentleman of the
island, charitably taken him in; and a doctor of a
merchant ship then in the road under convoy of Southampton
searched his wounds and applied proper
remedies."</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that this man could say nothing
relative to what had happened on the <i>Association</i>. But
we arrive at the origin of the story from what Herbert
relates, and he alone. He says: "About one or two
after noon on the 23rd (22nd) October Sir Cloudesley
called a council and examined the masters what latitude
they were in; all agreed to be in that of Ushant,
on the coast of France, except Sir W. Jumper's master
of the <i>Lenox</i>, who believed them to be nearer Scilly,
and that in three hours (they) should be up in sight
thereof. But Sir Cloudesley listened not to a single
person whose opinion was contrary to the whole fleet.
(They then altered their opinion and thought themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
on the coast of France, but a lad on board the
---- said the light they made was Scilly light, though
all the ship's crew swore at and gave him ill language
for it; howbeit he continued in his assertion, and that
which they made (to be) a sail and a ship's lanthorn
proved to be a rock and the light afore mentioned,
which rock the lad called the Great Smith, of the truth
of which at daybreak they were all convinced.)"</p>

<p>This is the small egg out of which so large a fable
has hatched forth. The boy was probably drowned, and
his parents or relations on Scilly, angry that his advice
had not been taken and so the wreck avoided, felt
resentment against Sir Cloudesley on this account, and
little by little magnified the incident, and transmuted it
from an error of judgment into a crime.</p>

<p>Beside Sir Cloudesley on board the <i>Association</i> were
Lady Shovell's two sons by her first husband, Admiral
Sir John Narborough. These were Sir John Narborough,
Bart., and his brother James; Edmund
Loader, the captain; also a nephew, the son of her first
husband's sister; Henry Trelawny, second son of the
Bishop of Winchester; and several other young gentlemen
of good family.</p>

<p>After that Sir Cloudesley had adopted the prevailing
opinion that the squadron was off Ushant; he detached
the <i>Lenox</i>, <i>La Valeur</i>, and the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i> for Falmouth,
with orders to take under convoy the merchant vessels
waiting there bound eastward. These ships, following
a north-easterly course, as had been determined on,
soon found themselves among the myriad rocks and
islets that lie to the south-west of the Scilly group,
where the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i> sustained so much damage that her
captain and crew only saved the ship and themselves
by running her ashore on the sands between Tresco
and S. Martin's Islands. The <i>Lenox</i> and <i>La Valeur</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
were fortunately able to beat through to Broad Sound,
an anchorage to the west of the principal islands, where
they remained till break of day on the ensuing morning.
Then they discovered where they were, and sailed for
Falmouth, in the direction in which they now knew that
it lay, and arrived there on the 25th, bringing news of
the wreck of the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, but knowing nothing of the
mishap to the vessels of the squadron from which they
had been detached.</p>

<p>J. Addison, in a letter dated October 31st, 1707,
wrote: "Yesterday we had the news that the body of
Sir Cloudesley Shovel was found on the coast of Cornwall.
The fishermen, who were searching among the
rocks, took a tin-box out of the pocket of one of the
carcasses that was floating, and found in it the commission
of an Admiral, upon which, examining the body
more closely, they found it was poor Sir Cloudesley.
You may guess the conditions of his unhappy wife,
who lost, in the same ship with her husband, her two
only sons by Sir John Narborough."</p>

<p>In an article on Sir Cloudesley by Mr. S. R. Pattison,
in the <i>Journal of the R. Inst. of Cornwall</i>, October,
1864, he says: "On a recent visit to the site of Sir
Cloudesley's first burial place, on the inner shore of
Porthellic Cove, we were informed by our guides&mdash;fishermen
and pilots&mdash;that the body of the unfortunate
Admiral when washed ashore was on a grating, on
which was also the dead body of his faithful Newfoundland
dog. They are said to have been found, early in
the morning after the wreck, by a woman named
Thomas, then living at Sallakey farm&mdash;a short distance
from the Cove. Mrs. Thomas immediately gave information
and procured assistance from Sallakey, and
the body of the unfortunate hero was buried at the
inmost part of the Cove, near the junction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
shingle and the herbage, but within and at right angles
with the latter. And here it remains, conspicuous from
no inconsiderable distance, without a particle of verdure
to obscure the brilliancy of the white shingle which occupies
its space, in marked contrast with the dense herbage
by which it is surrounded on three of its sides. Our
guides asserted that this strange appearance of the grave
is due to an imprecation uttered upon Sir Cloudesley a
few hours previous to the wreck, and (as they, with other
Scillonians, superstitiously believe) with more than
human power of prophecy. The islanders assert that
ever since the body of a cruel tyrant, as they deem the
hero, rested in this grave, grass has never grown upon its
surface, and they are confident it never will grow there."</p>

<p>"Sir Cloudesley Shovel's body being the next day
after this misfortune taken up by some country fellows,
was stripped and buried in the sand. But on inquiry
made by the boats of the <i>Salisbury</i> and <i>Antelope</i>, it
was discovered where he was hid; from whence being
taken out, and the earth wash'd off, he appeared as
fresh as if alive, tho' he had lain interr'd from the 23rd
to the 26th, on which day he was brought on board the
<i>Salisbury</i>, embowell'd, and the 28th of that month
brought into Plymouth, from whence he was afterwards
carried to London. This was the fatal end of
one of the greatest sea-commanders of our age, or,
indeed, that ever this island produced. Of undaunted
courage and resolution, of wonderful presence of
mind in the hottest engagements, and of consummate
skill and experience. But more than all this, he was a
just, frank, generous, honest, good man. He was the
artificer of his own fortune, and by his personal merit
alone, from the lowest, rais'd himself almost to the
highest station in the navy of Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span></p>
<p>But we have a much more detailed and accurate
account of the finding of the body in the narrative of
Mr. Edmund Herbert: I do not give the contractions
as in the original. "Sir Cloudesley Shovell [was] cast
away October 23rd [actually on the evening of the
22nd], being Wednesday, between six and seven at
night, off Guilstone, [and] was found on shoar [at
Porthellick Cove] in S. Marie's Island, stript of his
shirt, which by confession was known to have been
done by two women, which shirt had his name at the
gusset at his waist; where by order of Mr. Harry Pennick,
[it] was buried four yards off the sands; which
place I myself viewed, and as [I] was by his grave,
came the said woman that first saw him after he was
stript. His ring was also lost from off his hand, which
last, however, left the impression on his finger, as also
of a second. The Lady Shovell offered a considerable
reward to any one [who] should recover it for her, and
in order thereto wrote Captain Benedick Dennis,
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Islands of
Scilly, giving him a particular description thereof,
who used his utmost diligence, both by fair and foul
means, though could not hear of it. Sir Cloudesley
had on him a pair of thread stockings and a thread
waistcoat. Mr. Child [Paxton] of the <i>Arundell</i> caused
him to be taken up, and knew him to be Sir Cloudesley
by a certain black mole under his left ear, as also by
the first joint of one of his forefingers being broken
inwards formerly by playing at tables; the said joint
of his finger was also small and taper, as well as standing
somewhat inwards; he had likewise a shot in his
right arm, another in his left thigh. Moreover, he was
well satisfied that it was he, for he was as fresh when
his face was washed as if only asleep; his nose likewise
bled as though alive.... Many that saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
said his head was the largest that ever they had seen,
and not at all swelled with the water, neither had he
any bruise or scar about him, save only a small scratch
above one of his eyes like that of a pin. He was a very
lusty, comely man, and very fat."</p>

<p>Nearly 1800 lives were lost in this disastrous shipwreck.
The <i>Association</i>, the <i>Eagle</i>, and the <i>Romney</i>
were totally lost with every soul on board save the one
we have already heard of. The <i>Firebrand</i> had struck
and foundered, but her captain and seventeen men
were saved in a boat, and two more of her crew got on
shore on pieces of the wreck.</p>

<p>Sir Cloudesley's was the first body that came on
shore, and there was a woman who at once stripped it
and robbed it of its rings. One of these was a fine
emerald set with diamonds, which is said to have been
given to the Admiral by his intimate friend and comrade,
James Lord Dursley, who so nearly shared his
fate in the <i>S. George</i>. Although strict inquiries were
made for this ring, no tidings could be heard of it.
Lady Shovel then granted a pension for life to the
woman and her husband who had found the body. Many
years after a terrible confession was made by a dying
woman to a clergyman of S. Mary's Island. She said
that the Admiral had been cast ashore exhausted and
faint, but still living, and that she had squeezed the
life out of him for the sake of his clothes and his rings.
She produced the long-missing emerald hoop, and
gave it to the clergyman, saying that she had been
afraid to sell it lest it should lead to a discovery of her
guilt, and she added that she could not die in peace
until she had made this full confession. This disclosure
was made between the years 1732 and 1736,
after the death of Lady Shovel. The ring was sent to
Lord Dursley, who became Earl of Berkeley in 1701,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
and from him it descended to his grandson, Sir George
Cranfield Berkeley, and in the possession of one of his
descendants it still remains, but has unfortunately been
converted into a locket.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The <i>History of the Reign of Queen Anne</i>, 1708, says
that on "December 23rd was performed the interment
of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, whose body, after having
lain in state for many days, at the Queen's expense,
was conveyed from his late dwelling-house in Soho
Square, to the Abbey of Westminster, where it was
buried with all pomp and magnificence suitable to her
Majesty's high regard to the remains of so brave and
faithful a commander. There were at the ceremony
the Queen's trumpets, kettle-drums, and household
drums, with other music; the Queen's and the Prince's
watermen in their liveries, most of the nobility's coaches
with six horses, and flag-officers that were in town, and
the Prince's Council, the Heralds-at-Arms, and the
Knights' Marshal men."</p>

<p>Sir Cloudesley, by his wife, the widow of Sir John
Narborough, left two daughters, of whom the elder,
Elizabeth, married first, 1708, Sir Robert Marsham,
Bart., who was created Baron Romney in 1716; and,
secondly, Lord Carmichael, afterwards Earl of Hyndford.
The second daughter, Anne, married in 1718
the Hon. Robert Mansel; and, secondly, John Blackwood,
Esq., by whom she had Shovell Blackwood, of
Pitreavie, Fife, N.B., and of Crayford, Kent, and a
daughter.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who married Sir Robert Marsham, had
issue Robert, second Baron Romney, and the Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
Elizabeth Marsham, who married Sir Jacob Bouverie,
third Baronet, created Viscount Folkestone in 1747,
as his second wife, and by him had the Hon. Philip
Bouverie, who assumed the name of Pusey, and so
became the ancestress of Dr. Pusey.</p>

<p>Among those lost as well as Sir Cloudesley Shovel
was, as already stated, Henry, son of Sir Jonathan
Trelawny, Bart., Bishop of Winchester.</p>

<p>A letter from John Ben, of S. Hilary, dated November
16th, 1707, describing the finding of his body, has
been printed in the second volume of the Penzance
Natural History Society. I give it in modern spelling.</p>

<p>It was addressed to the father of the young man who
perished.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>"Your Lordship's commands having been signified
to my brother at Scilly, he immediately made
the strictest inquiry that was possible, all the bodies
that had been thrown ashore and buried, and being
told of one buried at Agnes about Mr. Trelawny's age,
was resolved to have him taken up in order to view
him, whether it was he or no. He had seen the young
gentleman at Torbay, but not willing to depend on his
own judgment, desired the Captain of the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i> fire-ship
that was stranded there, who knew Mr. Trelawny
intimately well all the voyage, to go with him. As
soon as they had the body up, they found it actually
to be the same, though somewhat altered, having been
buried eleven days, and in the water four; however, the
captain presently knew him, and my brother took care
to have the body brought over to S. Mary's, and interred
it in the chancel of the church there the 8th
instant, with all the marks of respect and honour the
island could show on such an occasion, some captains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
and the best of the inhabitants being present at
the funeral. My brother took of his hair, being cut
and that so close that the left lock was not left to send
over, and there is no room to doubt but 'twas the body
of poor Mr. Henry Trelawny. It has not been his
good luck as yet to meet with anything belonging to
him, but whatever of the nature happens to come to his
hand or knowledge your lordship will be sure to have
a faithful account of it. They can say nothing in
particular touching Sir Cloudesley's loss, only the man
saved out of the <i>Romney</i> tells that Sir Cloud was to the
windward of all the ships, and fired three guns when
he struck, and immediately went down, as the <i>Romney</i>
a little after did. Upon hearing the guns, the rest of
the fleet that were directly bearing on the same rocks
changed their course, and stood more to the southward,
or else, in all probability, they had run the same fate,
which is never enough to be admired; and 'twas possible
men of so much experience could be mistaken in their
reckoning, after they had the advantage of a great deal
of fair weather beforehand, and no bad weather when
they were lost. There is a great quantity of timber all
round the islands and abundance of sails and rigging
just about the place where the ships sunk, and a mast,
one end a little above water, which makes them conclude
an entire ship to be foundered there, because all
the force they can procure is not able to move the mast.
The <i>Eagle</i> most certainly is lost too, and I wish no
other of the squadron may be wanting; besides those,
though I am heartily sorry for the loss poor England
has sustained of so many men and in a most particular
manner for the share your lordship has."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a postscript Mr. Ben adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The <i>Hound</i> came from Scilly yesterday, and was
very near being taken, having three privateers behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
and two before her, but she escaped by creeping along
the shore, where they would not adventure."</p>

<h2>FRANCIS TREGIAN</h2>


<p>The Tregion or Tregian family was one of
great antiquity and large landed estates in
Cornwall. Indeed, in the reign of Elizabeth
it was estimated that the landed property
brought in £3000 per annum, which represents a very
much larger sum now. Their principal seat was Wolvedon,
or Golden, in the parish of Probus, and this, when
Leland wrote in the reign of Henry VIII, was in process
of being built with great magnificence. But bad days
were in store for some of the Cornish families that
would not accept the changes in religion.</p>

<p>Carew, in his <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, 1602, speaking of
Tregarrick, then the residence of Mr. Buller, the
sheriff, says: "It was sometime the Wideslade's
inheritance, until the father's rebellion forfeited it," and
the "son then led a walking life with his harp to gentlemen's
houses, where-through, and by his other active
qualities, he was entitled Sir Tristram; neither wanted
he (as some say) a <i>belle Isounde</i>, the more aptly to resemble
his pattern."</p>

<p>The rebellion referred to was the rising in the West
against the religious innovations, that was put down
so ruthlessly.</p>

<p>During the first years of Elizabeth there had been no
persecution of the Papists. Such as would not conform
to the Church of England as reformed were allowed to
have priests to say Mass in their own private chapels.
But after Pius V, on April 27th, 1570, had issued a Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
of excommunication against the Queen, depriving her
of her title to the crown, and absolving her subjects
from their oaths of allegiance; and when it became evident
that insurrections were being provoked by secret agents
from Rome in all directions, Elizabeth's patience was
at an end, and stringent laws were passed against those
who should enter England as missionary priests armed
with this Bull and with dispensations, as also against all
such as should harbour them.</p>

<p>On S. Bartholomew's Day, August 24th, 1572, had
taken place a massacre of the Huguenots in Paris and
throughout France, and this had been cordially approved
by Pope Gregory XIII, who had had a medal struck
to commemorate what he considered a meritorious deed.
There could exist no doubt that the Papal emissaries
in England were encouraged to assassinate the
Queen, though evidence to that effect was not obtained
till later.</p>

<p>On June 8th, 1577, Sir Richard Grenville of Stow,
sheriff of Cornwall, accompanied by some of his justices
of peace, arrived at Wolvedon to search the house for
Cuthbert Mayne, a priest who had arrived in England,
and who, it was supposed, was harboured by Mr.
Francis Tregian.</p>

<p>A hasty and superficial investigation was made, and no
seminary priest could be found. Then Mr. Tregian invited
the whole party in to dine with him, and when they
had been well regaled, and were somewhat flushed with
wine, Tregian foolishly joked with the sheriff for
hunting and finding nothing. Sir Richard started up
and vowed he would make a further inquest, and that
more thorough, and, finally, concealed in a hole under
a turret, Cuthbert Mayne was discovered, drawn forth,
and with him Tregian, for having harboured him, was
sent to Launceston gaol, there to await trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the gaol aforesaid, he was laid in a most loathsome
and lousy dungeon, laden with irons, deprived of
the use of writing, and bereaved of the comfort of reading,
neither permitted that any man might talk with him
touching any matter whatsoever, but by special licence
and in presence of the keeper."</p>

<p>The assizes were held at Launceston on the 16th
September, 1577, when indictments were made against
Cuthbert Mayne; Francis Tregian, Esq.; Richard Tremaine,
gentleman, of Tregonnan; John Kempe, gentleman,
of Rosteague; Richard Hore, gentleman, of
Trenoweth, and others. Cuthbert Mayne for high
treason: the others fell under the Statute of Præmunire,
and later and more specific acts.</p>

<p>The Statute of Præmunire was but one of several
that had been enacted from the time of Edward III,
against papal interference with the affairs of England.
The Statute of Præmunire was passed in 1393. "Whoever
procures at Rome or elsewhere, any translations,
processes, excommunications, bulls, instruments,
or other things which touch the King, against him,
his crown, and realms, and all persons aiding and
assisting therein, shall be put out of the King's protection,
their lands and goods forfeited to the King's use,
and they shall be attached by their bodies to answer to
the King and his Counsel: or process of <i>præmunire
facias</i> shall be made out against them, as in any other
case of prisoners."</p>

<p>The Bull that had been found in the possession of
Cuthbert Mayne was one from Pope Gregory XIII
granting plenary absolution from all their sins to English
Papists, as they were unable to attend the Pope's
jubilee at Rome, on condition that they should recite
the Rosary fifteen times.</p>

<p>The Bull might very well have been treated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
contempt it merited, but the fact of the possession
of such a document by Cuthbert Mayne was enough to
procure his condemnation, as it was against the laws
of England, and had been so for over one hundred and
eighty years.</p>

<p>The other gentlemen were liable either as having
received Cuthbert Mayne into their houses, or as having
heard him say Mass, and as absenting themselves from
their parish church.</p>

<p>Here came in the sharpened provisions enacted under
Henry VIII and Elizabeth.</p>

<p>As Judge Marwood said at the trial: "We have not
to do with your papistical use in absolving of sins.
You may keep it to yourselves, and although the date
of the Bull was expired and out of force, as you have
alleged, so was it always out of force with us, for we
never did, or never do account any such thing to be
of force or worth a straw, and yet the same is by law
of this realm treason, and therefore thou hast deserved
to die."</p>

<p>The main indictment ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou Cuthbert Maine art accused for that thou, the
1st October, in the eighteenth year of our Sovereign
lady the Queen that now is, did traitorously obtain from
the See of Rome a certain instrument printed, containing
a pretended matter of absolution of divers subjects
of the realm. The tenour of the which instrument doth
follow in these words: <i>Gregorius Episcopus</i>, <i>servus
servorum Dei</i>, etc., contrary to the form of a certain
statute in the thirteenth year of our Sovereign lady the
Queen, lately made and published, and contrary to her
peace, crown, and dignity. And that you," meaning
the rest, "after the said instrument obtained as aforesaid,
and knowing the said Cuthbert Maine to have
obtained the same from the Apostolic See, the 30th day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
of April, in the nineteenth of our said Sovereign the
Queen's reign, at Golden aforesaid, did aid, maintain,
and comfort the said Cuthbert Maine, of purpose
and intent to extol and set forth the usurped power
and authority of a foreign Prelate, that is to say,
the Bishop of Rome, teaching and concerning the
execution of the premises, contrary to the said statute
and published as aforesaid, and contrary to the place of
our Sovereign lady the Queen, her crown and dignity."</p>

<p>There were other indictments, as that Cuthbert
Mayne and these laymen had refused to attend service
in the parish church, and that the priest had brought
over a number of "vain things," such as an <i>Agnus Dei</i>
in silver or stone, which had been blessed by the Pope
and had been accepted by the laymen.</p>

<p>They all pleaded "Not guilty," but the evidence
against them sufficed for the jury to find that they
were guilty, whereupon Cuthbert Mayne was condemned
to death, and the rest to forfeit all their lands
and property and to be imprisoned.</p>

<p>"Whereupon there was a warrant sent unto the
Sheriff of Cornwall for the execution of Cuthbert
Maine. The day assigned for the same purpose was
dedicated unto S. Andrew; but on the eve before, all
the Justices of that County, with many preachers of the
pretended reformed religion, being gathered together
at Launceston, Cuthbert Maine was brought before
them, his legs being not only laden with mighty irons,
but his hands also fast fettered together (in which miserable
case he had also remained many days before), when
he maintained disputation with them concerning the
controversy in religion all this day in question, from
eight of the clock in the morning until it was almost
dark night, continually standing, no doubt in great
pain in that pitiful plight, on his feet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span></p>

<p>How that could be a great crime to distribute
some trumpery toys of crystal, and silver medals
marked with the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, one fails to see, but it
is possible that they may have been regarded as
badges, pledging those who received them to combine
in a rebellion against the State, and perhaps also to
unite in an assassination plot. That there was such a
plot appeared afterwards from the confession of Father
Tyrrell. At this time it was suspected, but not proved.
That harsh and cruel treatment was dealt out to these
men, we cannot doubt, but, as Mr. Froude remarks,
"were a Brahmin to be found in the quarters of a
Sepoy regiment scattering incendiary addresses, he
would be hanged also."</p>

<p>There were in all seven indictments.</p>

<p>At first Francis Tregian had not been committed to
gaol, but he was so shortly after, was brought to trial,
and was sentenced to the spoiling of his goods and to
a lifelong imprisonment.</p>

<p>Barbarous as these persecutions and sentences seem
to us to-day, there was some justification for the Queen
and Council at the time, surrounded as they were with
dangers.</p>

<p>The Papal Bull of excommunication had encouraged
the supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, and plots
were made on her behalf which were a constant source
of alarm to Elizabeth. One of these plots was managed
by an Italian named Ridolfi; the Duke of Norfolk had
a share in it, and was executed in consequence in 1572.
The great fear was lest France or Spain should take
advantage of the situation to invade England, while
Mary's friends raised insurrections at home. Mary's
friends were active in all parts. Numbers of young
Popish priests, trained to hostility towards Elizabeth,
were pouring into the country, and conspiracies against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
her life were numerous, explaining, though in no
degree justifying the stringent laws against seminary
priests and recusants.</p>

<p>To return to Cuthbert Mayne.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, according to the judgment he had
received, the next day he was uneasily laid on a hurdle,
and so drawn, receiving some knocks on his face and
his fingers with a girdle, unto the market-place of the
said town, where of purpose there was a very high
gibbet erected, and all things else, both fire and knives,
set to the show and ready prepared.</p>

<p>"At which place of execution, when he came, he
was first forced to mount the ladder backward, and
after permitted to use very few words. Notwithstanding
he briefly opened the cause of his condemnation,
and protested, that his master (Mr. Tregian) was never
privy with his having of these things whereupon he
was condemned&mdash;the Jubilee and the <i>Agnus Dei</i>; then
one of the justices, interrupting his talk, commanded
the hangman to put the rope about his neck, and then,
quoth he, let him preach afterward. Which done,
another commanded the ladder to be overturned, so as
he had not the leisure to recite <i>In manus tuas Domine</i>
to the end. With speed he was cut down, and with
the fall had almost ended his life, for the gibbet being
very high, and he being yet in the swing when the
rope was cut, he fell in such sort, as his head encountered
the scaffold which was there prepared of
purpose to divide the quarters, as the one side of his
face was sorely bruised, and one of his eyes far driven
out of his head.</p>

<p>"After he was cut down, the hangman first spoiled
him of his clothes, and then in butcherly manner,
opening his belly, he rent up his bowels, and after tore
out his heart, which he held up aloft in his hand, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
it unto the people. Lastly, his head was cut off,
and his body divided into four quarters, which afterwards
were dispersed and set up on the Castle of
Launceston; one quarter sent unto Bodmin; another
to Barnstaple; the third to Tregony, not a mile distant
from Mr. Tregian's house; the fourth to Wadebridge."</p>

<p>Not only was Francis Tregian adjudged to forfeit
his goods, but he was also prosecuted by a goldsmith,
who claimed a debt of £70.</p>

<p>Accordingly he was sent up to London to the King's
Bench prison, "strongly guarded by a ruffianly sort of
bloody blue-coats, with bows, bills, and guns"; and
the arms of Tregian were pinioned behind his back
with cords. With him were associated the other Papists;
and they met with insult and harsh treatment all the
way to London. There he was again tried and cast
into prison.</p>

<p>We are gravely informed that before these calamities
befell Francis Tregian, a premonition of coming woes
had been given to his wife.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tregian, her husband, not many days after
they were first married, enforced for ten months to
follow the Lords of the Council, his wife always in the
mean season lying with a very virtuous maid, a sister
of her husband's, it chanced that one night looking for
fleas, as the manner of women is, she espied in her
smock sundry spots, the which she perceived to carry
the shape of sundry crosses. Whereat she, much
marvelling, besought her sister to behold the same;
whereupon, when both had long looked and wondered,
at length endeavouring to number them, they found
contained in the same smock no less than one hundred
and twenty-five crosses, and after, upon more curious
search, they likewise found sundry other, both on her
pillow and in her sheets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span></p>

<p>This omen of coming evil was now verified, but not
by flea-bites. Francis Tregian remained in prison
cruelly treated, and when he attempted to make his
escape, manacled and fettered in a loathsome dungeon.
From his cell he wrote in verse to his wife, but did not
display much brilliancy of poetic art.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My wont is not to write in verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You know, good wife, I wis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore you well may bear with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though now I write amiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lack of ink the candle coal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For pen a pin I use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which also I may allege<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In part of my excuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For said it is of many men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And such as are no fools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A workman is but little worth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If he do want his tools;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though tools I have wherewith in sort<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My mind I may disclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are, in truth, more fit to paint<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A nettle than a rose.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so on, never rising to a higher level.</p>

<p>But his wife was allowed to visit him, and indeed
reside with him in prison. "And although through the
rigour of authority they have been often separated,
sometimes two months, sometimes seven, sometimes
more, she hath borne him, notwithstanding, eleven
children since he was first imprisoned. Some are
dead, but the most part are alive."</p>

<p>Francis Tregian was first committed to prison in the
twenty-eighth year of his age, and in the year 1595,
when he had been about sixteen years in prison, some
notes were drawn up concerning him, from which some
quotations may be made.</p>

<p>In all the sixteen years' space he had never been permitted
to enjoy the benefit of the open air otherwise
than when being removed from one prison to another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
He was first imprisoned at Launceston, then was removed
to Windsor Castle; thence removed to the
Marshalsea, and then again carried back to Launceston
Castle. Then he was conveyed to the King's Bench
prison, and lastly to the Fleet.</p>

<p>For seven or eight years together he enjoyed good
health; "but in the end, through cares, studies, filthy
diet, most stinking air, and want of exercise, he became
very sickly, and so continued by the space of six or
seven years; notwithstanding at this present the state
of his body is much mended, and is like to recover his
perfect health."</p>

<p>His mother was the eldest sister of Sir John Arundell,
Knight, of Lanherne. His great-grandmother was one
of the daughters of Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorchester,
half-brother to Queen Elizabeth, the wife of
King Henry VII, and daughter of Edward IV. He
married the eldest sister of Lord Stourton. His wife's
mother was eldest sister of the Earl of Derby. Francis
Tregian remained in prison eighteen years, and was
finally released by order of Queen Elizabeth in or
about 1597, after which he lived in London on the
bounty of his friends.</p>

<p>His son, Francis, managed to repossess himself, by
the assistance of some of his friends and relatives, by
purchase of some portion of the ancestral property,
but in January, 1608, owing to the hostility provoked
by the Gunpowder Plot against the Papists, the family
was again plundered of the estates, and when the
Heralds' Visitation of Cornwall was taken in 1620, the
family had disappeared from the list of the landed and
heraldic gentry.</p>

<p>Francis Tregian, the elder, at last retired to Lisbon,
where he died on the 25th September, 1608. He was
allowed by the King of Portugal sixty crowns a month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
On his tombstone it was stated, falsely, that he had
endured twenty-eight years of imprisonment in England.
As a specimen of the malignant lies that were
spread abroad relative to Queen Elizabeth, is this&mdash;given
in a life of Francis Tregian by Francis Plunket,
son of one of his daughters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aulam Elizabethæ adit ... Regina per pedissequam
illum invitat ad cubiculum, intempesta nocte;
recusantem adit, lectoque assistens ad impudica
provocat; rennentem increpat. Castitati suæ cusam
gerens ex Aula se proripuit, insalutata Regina; quæ
idcirco furit, et in carcerem detrudi jubet."</p>

<p>Such words fill one with disgust and indignation
against the pack from Rheims and Rome, who, unable
to reach the Queen with their daggers, bespattered her
with foul words.</p>

<p>The <i>Life of Francis Tregian</i> was published in
Portuguese, at Lisbon, by Francis Plunket, in 1655.
The narrative of his imprisonment, written in 1593, is
published <i>in extenso</i> by J. Morris, <i>The Troubles of our
Catholic Forefathers</i>, 1st series, London, 1872, from
the original MS. in S. Mary's College, Oscott.</p>

<p>A summary is in C. S. Gilbert's <i>Historical Survey of
Cornwall</i>, 1817.</p>

<h2>ANN GLANVILLE</h2>


<p>Saltash was formerly a very much more
important place than it is to-day. Now the
tubular bridge of Brunel connects Cornwall
and Devon, and railway trains slip along
it, making communication with Plymouth from Cornwall
easy and speedy. It was not so in former
times. Then travellers from the West on their way
to Plymouth or to London, if they did not go by
coach by the great highway from Falmouth, by
Bodmin and Launceston, were brought up by the strip
of blue water that formed the estuary of the Tamar and
Tavy, called the Hamoaze, and there, after halting at
Saltash they were forced to cross in the ferry or by boat.
Saltash signifies the Saltwater&mdash;ash = <i>usk</i>, and Hamoaze
is the Border water, oaze = <i>usk</i> as well.</p>

<p>The Saltash boatmen plied a good trade, conveying
over the passengers from Cornwall to Devon. Moreover,
houses were cheap at Saltash, and old salts lived
there, where they could smell the sea air, and every
now and then crossed into Plymouth to do their shopping.
From time immemorial there had been boat-races
in the Hamoaze, and the women of Saltash were
not behind the men at plying the oar.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitfeld in his <i>Three Towns' History</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Saltash festival was by no means wholly
intended for the encouragement of the males, for the
'ladies' feathered their oars with such dexterity that
few of the opposite sex would enter the lists against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
them. Before the races for these damsels of uncertain
age were started, blue favours were tied round their
white caps by members of the committee. The fair
rowers were attired in short white bedgowns and blue
cap-guards, and their gigs shot around the course of
five miles 'like so many birds.' From a sporting point
of view the feature of the first regatta was a life or
death competition between Jacky Gould and the Glanvilles.
If Jacky's boat, <i>Miller's Daughter</i>, was the
crack, <i>Alarm</i> was scarcely inferior, and <i>Paul Pry</i> was
a first-class craft. Crash! went the starting-gun, and
the competitors dashed away with a flood tide and a
breeze from the northward. When they left on their
ten-mile course one vast shout went up, the boats flew
as instinct with life, every nerve on the stretch. The
first five miles were covered in thirty minutes, and as
the boats turned the committee vessel there were deafening
shouts of 'Bravo, Jacky.' 'Well done, Glanville!'
Then these hearts-of-oak flashed on their
second round, and excitement intensified as the telescope
reported progress. When the boats reappeared
the suspense broke into a feverish roar, and calls to the
rivals were tossed like corks on a sea of voices. Swiftly
they drew near, the boats in a line, the interest increased
to painful intensity as the race was neck-and-neck.
The judge stood by, red-hot poker in hand, and as the
bow of the <i>Alarm</i>, pulled by the Glanvilles, first
touched the hawsers of the committee vessel, Bang!
went the signal gun; 'See the Conquering Hero'
burst from the band, and hundreds clustered round to
congratulate the victors, and condole with Jacky Gould,
who was only five seconds behind, though the boat was
two feet shorter, and one of his crew had broken an
oar."</p>

<p>The Glanvilles were amphibious&mdash;or rather lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
almost wholly on the water during the day, only
returning to the land for sleep at night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_796.png" id="i_796.png"></a>
   <img src="images/i_796.png" alt="ANN GLANVILLE" title="ANN GLANVILLE" />
   <p class="caption2">ANN GLANVILLE</p>
</div>

<p>The name is old. The first Glanvilles of whom we
know anything authentic were located at Whitchurch,
near Tavistock, where they were tanners, but a Judge
Glanville raised the family to a higher position, in the
reign of Elizabeth. Some, however, remained in a
modest position, as did these boatmen of Saltash, and
as did a huntsman to the late Mr. Kelly, of Kelly.</p>

<p>There occurred a terrible tragedy in the family, when
Eulalia Glanville, niece of the Judge, murdered her
husband, old John Page, a merchant of Plymouth,
and was burnt alive for the crime, as one of petty
treason, at Barnstaple, in 1591.</p>

<p>In 1824 at the regatta was offered a prize of £8 for
a four-oared race for women, but no Glanville was in
that. Ten years later, in 1834, at the regatta £20 was
offered for boats sculled by women, and in this pulled
a Mary Glanville. But the queen of women scullers of
the Glanville stock was Ann, and she only entered it
by marriage, by birth a Warring.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Mr. P. E. B.
Porter, in his <i>Around and About Saltash</i>, 1905, thus
describes her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ann Glanville was undoubtedly a remarkable
woman for many reasons. Only such a place as
Saltash, in such a naval port as this, could have
produced a character like it. Only such a country
as England could have produced such a woman. She
was a genuine representative of Saltash in its great
nautical days, when it was alive with business. The
British tar was to her the ideal of a man and the very
highest type of a hero. Into whatever trouble Jack
got when ashore, however he might have been forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
by all else in his reckless frivolity, he never wanted for
a backer if Ann Glanville was near. And there was
not a ship in the navy, in those days, that had not
some story to tell of Ann's life and energy, and in
which her name was not cherished as only a British
sailor can cherish the memory of a friend. In a perfectly
true sense, Ann Glanville was a mother to
the British tar indiscriminately; she was known as
Mother, and called Mother, by all."</p>

<p>Ann was born at Saltash in 1796, and was the daughter
of a man named Warring or Werring. She married
a man several years her junior in years, and by him
became the mother of fourteen children. He was a
waterman, she a waterwoman, and their children,
every boy and girl, water-babies.</p>

<p>He had his boat, and when he was otherwise engaged&mdash;nursing
the children, for instance, or merry-making
in the tavern&mdash;she rowed across to Devonport.</p>

<p>Not passengers only, but goods were conveyed to
and from Plymouth by the boats. Corn, crockery,
drapery, everything except live cattle went in them.
These latter by the ferry. Sometimes she rowed out
officers to their ships, sometimes conveyed play-actors
over from Plymouth into Cornwall, and on the great
event of the elections at Saltash, candidates, electors,
pot-boilers, political orators. Meat and vegetables went
over in these boats to Plymouth market: a gentleman
remembers Ann bringing round as many as seventy
or eighty bags of corn in her boat from South Pool,
pulling the great cargo alone, conveying it from
Sutton Pool to Butt's Head Mill, a point two miles
above Saltash.</p>

<p>Ann's husband fell ill and was long confined to bed,
and the house and then the whole burden of supporting
the family fell to her. But she had strong arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
a stouter heart, and managed not only to keep the wolf
from the door, but the doctor as well.</p>

<p>"Have you got a doctor here, or have you to send
over to Plymouth for one?" she was asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe there may be one here, but, thank
God, here us most commonly dies a natural death."</p>

<p>Ann's fame as a rower at regattas spread throughout
England. Some sixty or seventy years ago the crew
of Saltash women was one of the most important features,
not only in the Hamoaze, but all over the county
wherever aquatic sports were given. She always rowed
stroke. It was very rarely that Ann and her crew were
beaten in a match&mdash;never by other women. The
strength and endurance of these women, and their daring
in accepting challenges and in the contests on the water,
attracted universal attention. They competed for prizes
at Hull, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Dartmouth, etc.,
and it must not be supposed that a male crew yielded
the palm to them out of masculine courtesy, for the
men did not at all relish being beaten by a "parcel o'
females," as they were sure to have the fact thrown in
their teeth afterwards.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harriet Screech, a daughter of Ann Glanville,
rowed along with her mother in some of these contests,
pulling the bow-oar, the least arduous post, assigned
to her as the youngest of the crew. When engaged in
a match at Fleetwood before the Queen, they gave the
men so sound a beating that Her Majesty requested to
have Ann presented to her.</p>

<p>But the most famous event of her life took place in
1850, when Captain Russell, of H.M.S. <i>Brunswick</i>,
suggested to her that she and her crew should go over
to Havre to the regatta there and challenge the Johnny
Crapauds. She was quite prepared, and started under
the escort of Captain Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Frenchmen heard of the challenge from
<i>les Anglaises de Saltashe</i>, they shrugged their shoulders,
and hardly regarded it as serious. And when the
strong, muscular women appeared in their white-frilled
caps prinked out with blue ribbon, their short petticoats,
white dresses, with a blue neckerchief tied over
the shoulders and crossed behind the back, they looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter says: "The challenge of the English
captain created a stir not only in Havre, but for miles
around the French coast, and for many leagues inland
too. In England great interest was felt in the forthcoming
match, and in a short time it assumed a kind of
international character. Thus when the regatta day
came there was a vast concourse of people to witness
the contest. Every quay, hill-top, and house-roof
whence a view of the course could be obtained was
crowded. All were on the tiptoe of expectation for <i>les
Anglaises</i>.... Before the start the Saltash crew had
a pull round 'to show themselves,' and when their
steady stroke was seen, how they bent their backs to
the work, yet with what perfect ease and grace they
pulled, our French friends opened their eyes wider
than usual. Ann and her crew had not the fairest start
possible, nor had they the advantage at first. Six
boats were ahead of them five minutes after the start.
But they soon tested their opponents. After a little
opening play to get into trim, Ann, who had the
stroke oar, gave the word, 'Bend your backs to
it, maidens; and hoorah for old England!' One
by one the French boats were passed with a cheer
from old Ann. At length the Saltash boat, with
the British colours flying gaily at the fore, took
the leading position. It was a long course and a
hard pull, but the Frenchmen were soundly thrashed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
Ann and her 'maidens' beat them by one hundred
yards."</p>

<p>However gallant Frenchmen may be, they did not
at all relish this beating.</p>

<p>The names of the crew were Ann Glanville, Harriet
Hosking, Jane House, and Amelia Lee. A man acted
as coxswain.</p>

<p>Mrs. House was so elated at the victory that on
reaching the committee boat she plunged into the
water, dived under the vessel, and came up with dripping
and drooping nightcap on the opposite side.</p>

<p>When the Prince of Wales, our present King, and
the Duke of Edinburgh came into Plymouth Sound in
connection with the building of the new Eddystone
Lighthouse, Ann was sent for. A steam launch was
despatched to convey her to the vessel, where were
their Highnesses, and she dined on board. Lord
Charles Beresford always entertained a high regard
for her, and never came to Plymouth without visiting
her. During her last illness she had his likeness placed
on one side of her bed, and that of her deceased
husband on the other.</p>

<p>She died in 1880 at the age of eighty-five. In
person Ann Glanville was tall, firmly and vigorously
built, not stout, straight about the bust and waist.
When young she must have been good-looking, for
when old her face was handsome and always possessed
great dignity. The mouth was firm. There was a
kindly light in her grey eyes. She was always fond
of a joke, and her character was summed up by a
neighbour: "Her was honest to a farthing, clean as a
smelt, and kind-hearted as a queen."</p>

<h2>JONATHAN SIMPSON, HIGHWAYMAN</h2>


<p>This great rascal was born at Launceston in
1654 of respectable parents, and his father,
who was well-off, apprenticed him to a linen
draper at Bristol when he was fourteen
years of age. When he had served out his time,
which he did with the repute of being a steady,
industrious youth, his father gave him fifteen hundred
pounds wherewith to set up in Bristol. About a year
after he unhappily married a woman who was the
cause of his downfall and finally of his death. She
had two thousand pounds of her own, and this added
to what he already possessed promised him a considerable
extension of his business with corresponding
profits.</p>

<p>But the girl he had chosen for his wife had previously
engaged herself to a young man of small
means, and her parents had forced her into marriage
with Simpson as being better off and with good
prospects. She resented her compulsory marriage,
and did not disguise her indifference to her husband.
Although her former lover, in a fit of disgust at his
rejection, had also married, Simpson ascertained that
they corresponded.</p>

<p>Determined to find out the truth, that she still loved
the man, he announced to his wife that he was going to
Launceston for ten or twelve days to see his relations.
As soon as he was gone his wife sent to invite her
<i>galant</i> to supper, and provided for his entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
a couple of fowls and a bottle of wine. Either the
fowls must have been very small, or their appetites
voracious.</p>

<p>In the evening Jonathan Simpson returned, entered
his house, and rushed to the dining-room. His wife
had but just time to shut her <i>galant</i> into the oak chest;
but not before Simpson had seen by the movement of
the lid that he was there. However, he gave no token
of having perceived anything, expressed his delight
at so good a supper having been prepared, and despatched
his wife to the further end of the town on
an errand. No sooner was she gone than he sent for
the wife of "Pil-Garlic," and on her arrival disclosed
the man in the box, and enjoyed the scene of recrimination
that ensued.</p>

<p>The vexation at the discovery he had made that he
could expect no domestic happiness created a great
change in Jonathan Simpson's life. He sold his business,
refused to receive his wife back into his house
again, and with all the money he could scrape together
that amounted to five thousand pounds, quitted Bristol,
and swore he would never re-enter it.</p>

<p>He now led a riotous life, spending his money so
freely that at the end of eighteen months all his five
thousand pounds was gone, and then he took to the
road to supply himself with more. After a while he
was arrested for highway robbery, and was sent to the
Old Bailey, tried, and condemned to be hanged.</p>

<p>His relatives at Launceston now exerted themselves
to obtain a reprieve, and by bribery and persuasion
they got one, but only at the last moment. Simpson
was already under the gallows, with the rope round his
neck, when it arrived, and the execution was arrested.</p>

<p>As he was riding back to Newgate behind one of the
sheriff's officers that man asked him what he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
of a reprieve as he stood on the scaffold. "No more,"
answered Simpson, "than I thought of my dying
day."</p>

<p>On reaching the prison door the turnkey refused to
admit him, declaring that he could not take him in
again without a fresh warrant; and as this could not
well be obtained, the sheriff's officer was obliged to let
him go free.</p>

<p>"Well," said Simpson, "what an unhappy dog am
I! that both Tyburn and Newgate should in one day
refuse to entertain me. I'll mend my manners for the
future, and try whether I cannot merit a reception at
them both the next time I am brought thither."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and after his release
is believed to have committed above forty robberies in
the county of Middlesex within the ensuing six weeks.</p>

<p>He was a good skater, and made a practice of robbing
people on the ice between Fulham and Kingston
Bridge, in the great frost of 1689, which held for
thirteen weeks. He would kick up their heels, and
search their pockets as they lay sprawling on the ice.</p>

<p>On one occasion a gentleman whom he stopped gave
him a silk purse full of counters, which Simpson took for
gold, and so did not examine them till he reached the
inn where he put up. When he found that he had been
outwitted he quietly pocketed the brass booty, and
abided his time till he should meet the same gentleman
again. This he did at the end of four months, when
he waylaid him on Bagshot Heath, where, riding up to
the coach, he said, as he presented a pistol at the
gentleman's head, "Sir, I believe you made a mistake
the last time I had the happiness to see you, in giving
me these pieces. I have been troubled ever since for
fear you should have wanted these counters at cards,
and am glad of this opportunity to return them. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
for my care I require you this moment to descend from
your coach and give me your breeches, that I may
search them at leisure, and not trust any more to your
generosity, lest you should mistake again."</p>

<p>The gentleman was obliged to comply, and Simpson
carried off the breeches with him to his inn, and on
searching them found a gold watch, a gold snuff-box,
and a purse containing ninety-eight guineas and five
gold jacobuses.</p>

<p>On another occasion he robbed Lord Delamere in
an ingenious fashion. That nobleman was driving
over Dumoor Heath in his coach well attended by
armed servants. Simpson rode up to the carriage and
told his lordship that he had been waylaid and robbed
by some rogues, two in number, at a little distance.
Lord Delamere at once despatched his armed and
mounted escort in pursuit, and Simpson took the
opportunity of their absence to rob the nobleman of
forty pounds. After that experience Lord Delamere
vowed he would never again show kindness to a
stranger.</p>

<p>At last Simpson was taken near Acton by means
of two captains of the Foot Guards, where he attempted
to rob both together. There ensued an obstinate fight
between them, and Simpson behaved with so much
bravery that in all probability he would have escaped,
had not one of the officers shot the horse on
which he rode, which, falling, carried Jonathan down
with it. He had already been wounded in his arms
and one of his legs, but both his opponents were also
wounded and bleeding. Whilst on the ground he
continued to resist with desperation whilst extricating
himself from his fallen horse; but the sound of the
fray had called up other passengers, and he was overmastered
and sent to Newgate, where he found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
keeper so much of a friend that on this occasion he
was ready to receive him. Tyburn also was sufficiently
hospitable not to reject him, and he was hanged
on Wednesday, 8th September, 1686, in his thirty-third
year.</p>

<h2>DAVIES GILBERT</h2>


<p>The simple and quiet life of a country gentleman
who does not hunt, but spends his
days in the library among books, or at his
desk making calculations, presents little of
interest to the general reader. But Davies Gilbert is
not a man to be passed over in a collection of minor
worthies of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert's original name was Giddy, and he was
the grandson of a Mr. John Giddy, of Truro, who had
two sons, Edward and Thomas; the former took Holy
Orders, and became curate of S. Erth, and never
obtained any better preferment. Here he married
Catherine, daughter of John Davis, of Tredrea, the
representative of several ancient families, and inheriting
what fragments were left of the property of William
Noye, Attorney-General in the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>At S. Erth was born, 6 March, 1767, Davies Giddy,
the subject of this sketch. After having been</p>

<p>at Penzance, he passed to Oxford, and entered Pembroke
College, his father going up to Oxford to reside with
him. Dr. Johnson, who was also of Pembroke, once
said, in allusion to the poetical characters brought up
there, that it was a veritable nest of singing-birds.
Davies Giddy was not a singer or a poet himself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
taught others to sing, for he collected and published
the traditional Cornish carols with their melodies, now
taken into every book of Christmas carols and sung at
the feast of Noël from John o' Groats House to the
Land's End, in America, India, and Australia. Probably
this little gathering was one of the works Davies Giddy,
or Gilbert, least valued of his many productions, but it
has been the most enduring, and will be deathless so
long as English voices carol.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Davies Giddy, but of older
standing in the college, was that strange man Dr.
Thomas Beddoes, lecturer on chemistry, whose head
was turned by fanatical republicanism, and who was
an enthusiastic admirer of the French Revolution, and
prepared to condone the horrors of the Reign of Terror.
This was too much for most of Beddoes' friends, who
fell away from him, but Davies Giddy, though in
politics standing at the other pole, appreciated the
great abilities of the doctor, shrugged his shoulders at
his political opinions, and refrained from absolutely
breaking off all intercourse with him, even when Beddoes
was obliged to resign the professorship he held at the
University.</p>

<p>Beddoes, on leaving Oxford, set up a pneumatic
institution at Clifton, near Bristol, for the cure of consumption,
by pumping air into the lungs of those
afflicted with phthisis. This was a great discovery,
which was to sweep this scourge out of England. The
pneumatic bellows worked night and day, and the
patients gasped, inhaled and spurted the air back
through their nostrils, till the arms of the bellows-workers
ached, but, alas for suffering mankind, the
pneumatic process proved a dead failure.</p>

<p>Davies Giddy after leaving Oxford went to a surgeon,
Bingham Borlase, at Penzance, to prepare for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
medical profession, intending after a stay with Borlase
to complete his education at the Medical School of
Edinburgh. With Dr. Borlase was a lad, Humphry Davy,
who had been articled to him in 1793, when
little more than fourteen years old. He was a youth
of active frame, and with a bright, intelligent face, with
wavy brown hair, and eyes "tremulous with light."
Not only was Davy a keen fisherman, but he was
enthusiastic as a chemist; but he had no particular
desire to spend his life as a Sangrado in Penzance.
Davies Giddy speedily recognized the flashes of genius
in the lad, and recommended him to go to the pump-house
of Dr. Beddoes as an assistant at a modest
salary. As Beddoes experimented with various gases
on his unfortunate patients there was at all events
an element of novelty in the venture. Mr. Giddy
abandoned his intention of entering the medical profession,
and, having a sufficient income to support
himself, he devoted his whole time to scientific work,
and became well known as a geologist and botanist,
and he associated with all the literary and scientific
men of his native duchy.</p>

<i>President of the Royal Society&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Member of Parliament&mdash;&amp;c</i><br />
<i>1828</i><br />
<i>From the collection of Mrs. Lewis Lane</i></p>
</div>

<p>The introduction of Watt's improvement in the
steam-engine into the Cornish mines and the disputes
between that great mechanical inventor and Jonathan
Hornblower, of Penryn, as to the economy and mode
of applying the principle of working steam expansively,
early attracted the attention of Davies Giddy, and
Hornblower had frequent recourse to him, as a mathematician,
to work out his calculations for him, and to
advise as to his experiments, and approve or criticize
his inventions. Trevithick also had recourse constantly
for the same purpose to Mr. Giddy, and the latter was
solicited by the county to take an active part in determining
the advantages of Watt's engines; and in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
with Captain W. Jenkin, of Treworgie, he
made a survey of all the steam-engines then working
in Cornwall.</p>

<p>One of the most laborious and practically useful
works of Giddy was a treatise on the properties of the
Catenary Curve. This fine example of mathematical
investigation was published whilst Telford was preparing
materials for the Menai Straits Bridge; and Telford
was so convinced by Mr. Giddy's tract, that he altered
the construction of the bridge in accordance with what
Giddy had laid down, causing the suspension chains,
which had already been completed, to be again taken
in hand and lengthened by about thirty-six feet.</p>

<p>In 1804 Giddy was elected into Parliament as representative
of that rotten borough Helston, but at the
next election, in 1806, he was returned for Bodmin,
and continued its member till the Reform Bill abolished
these nests of corruption. In Parliament he was rarely
heard to speak, but his judgment was always valued
there, and had great influence on questions of a practical
nature.</p>

<p>In 1811, when the high price of gold produced an
ominous effect on the currency of the realm, and when
the public mind became greatly agitated by the depreciation
of bank notes, Davies Giddy published <i>A
Plain Statement of the Bullion Question</i>, with the object
of allaying the public ferment. Against great opposition
he carried an extra twelve feet in width to the
design for rebuilding London Bridge.</p>

<p>In 1808 he married Mary Ann Gilbert, an heiress, of
Eastbourne, in Sussex, whose family name he afterwards
assumed, on account of the hereditary estates to which
he became entitled through this marriage.</p>

<p>This lady was of a strong, determined character. On
one occasion when riding she was thrown, and dislocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>
her shoulder. Laying hold of her hunting-crop
with both hands, she threw herself back and so
brought the joint back into its place.</p>

<p>Once she had a dispute with some farmers, who
would not continue their farms without a great reduction
of rent. "Very well," said she; "then I will farm
them myself." And she did so, and made them pay.
She was the first in England to introduce the allotment
system on a farm of hers at Eastbourne, Sussex. The
marriage was due to Mr. Giddy meeting her when she
was staying with her mother on a visit to Mr. Fry at
Penzance.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman, with a determined face,
and she suited her husband admirably, for she was
interested in many of the subjects that he took up.
She was an authoress, moreover&mdash;she wrote upon
"Tanks," "On an Improved Mode of Forming Water
Tanks," "On the Construction of Tanks," in 1836,
1838, and 1840. Also "On the Self-supporting Reading,
Writing, and Agricultural School at Willingdon, in
Sussex," 1842.</p>

<p>On the death of Sir Joseph Banks the unanimous
voice of the Royal Society called Sir Humphry Davy
to the chair, and at the same time Davies Gilbert&mdash;as
he now was&mdash;was nominated Treasurer under the man
whom he had first helped to start in his career. Ill-health
having obliged Sir Humphry Davy to quit
England in the early part of 1827, Mr. Gilbert occupied
the chair as Vice-President, and when finally Sir
Humphry retired in the same year he was chosen
President.</p>

<p>At that time a President was elected for life, but
Davies Gilbert considered this to be unadvisable, and
urged that the election should be for a term only; and
his recommendation was accepted after a few years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
when the presidency was required for the Duke of
Sussex; thereupon it was hinted to him that he should
act upon his expressed opinion and leave the chair for
His Royal Highness. This he did without reluctance.</p>

<p>On his wife's estate in Sussex he introduced the
Cornish stiles, of gridiron fashion&mdash;strips of stone laid
down with an interval between each&mdash;and this prevents
horses, donkeys, and cattle from adventuring to cross
them. But the Sussex people on the Eastbourne estate
revolted, and declared that they would not break their
legs to please any Cornish Giddy or Sussex Gilbert,
and he was constrained to remove them all.</p>

<p>He was a man of a versatile mind. He published,
with a translation by J. Keigwin and W. Jordan, the
early Cornish mystery plays of <i>Mount Calvary</i> and the
<i>Creation of the World</i>.</p>

<p>He also undertook a Parochial History of Cornwall,
giving first Hals' account from his MS., now in the
British Museum, with additions from Tonkin, and a
geological account of each parish by Dr. Boase, of no
great value, and his own additions. This was published
in five volumes in 1838.</p>

<p>He wrote also on steam-engines, on the employment
of sea salt as a manure, on the improvement of wheels
and springs for carriages, on the <i>Eikon Basilike</i>. He
translated the Liturgy into Greek. Chambers in his
<i>Journal</i>, Vol. II, 1844, has an account of the improvements
effected on his wife's estate at Eastbourne.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Goldsmith upset the Logan Rock
he got the use of timber and ropes granted for the
work of replacing the stone, and had the loan of the
same also to replace the coverstone of Lanyon Quoit.</p>

<p>Lord Sidmouth offered him the position of Under-Secretary
of State, but he declined the offer.</p>

<p>About a year before his death Davies Gilbert entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
in his notebook: "Slept in a house for the first time
on my own property." This was a house in East Looe
bequeathed to him by Thomas Bond, who had written
the <i>History of Looe</i>, and who died unmarried and without
near relatives.</p>

<p>Davies Gilbert died at Eastbourne on Christmas Eve,
1839, as the carollers, for whom he had done so much,
were going round in the dark under the stars singing&mdash;</p>

<h2>JAMES HOSKIN, FARMER</h2>


<p>Castell-an-Dinas was the most complete
and perfect relic of prehistoric times
existing in Cornwall, till a Mr. Rogers, of
Penrose, took it into his head to erect a
tower on the summit, that was neither useful nor
beautiful, and to obtain material the walls of the fort
were pulled about and pillaged. It is still an interesting
specimen of a hill fortress, notwithstanding the mischief
wrought by the builder of the tower.</p>

<p>On the side of the swelling hill crowned by the old
fortress is a small walled enclosure, like a donkey-pound,
and in this is the tomb of James Hoskin, a
farmer, who desired that he might not be laid in
consecrated ground. He was buried in 1823 at the age
of 63. He was baptized at Ludgvan on March 8th,
1760, and was the son of James Hoskin.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, three headstones within the enclosure:
that which is central is to James Hoskin; on
the left is one to his eldest son, who died in 1812, aged
20, and above it is the inscription, "Custom is the idol
of Fools"; on the right is one to a married daughter
and her child, also in 1812, the mother aged 22 and the
daughter 7, probably months, not years, in this latter
case. Above this headstone is the inscription: "Virtue
only consecrates the ground." But although there be
these three memorial stones, only James Hoskin, the
father, aged 63, lies here.</p>

<p>What caused James Hoskin to desire to be interred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>
on the moor away from consecrated ground? Tradition
in Ludgvan says that he kissed the parson's wife, and
the rector, furious at the insult&mdash;his name was J.
Stephens&mdash;vowed that if he survived Hoskin he would
bury him in the most obscure corner of the graveyard
on the north side of the church. So in order to defeat
the parson's intentions, he made provision for his body
to be buried at Castell-an-Dinas. Whether this be
true or not I cannot say, but certain it is that there
was a lasting difference between J. Hoskin and the
Rev. J. Stephens.</p>

<p>The Hoskin family lived in a farm, Treassow,
Castell-an-Dinas, the original seat of the Rogers Family
from before 1633. Sold by Captain J. P. Rogers
recently.</p>

<p>His was a small yeoman family in very fair circumstances.
James Hoskin had two sons who lived, besides
John, the eldest, who died young. These were John
William and Richard Vinnicombe. This last went
as a clerk to Jamaica to Sir Rose Price. His grandsons
are now living in Ludgvan. According to some
poor inflated verses, written by a Miss Lean, of Ludgvan,
in 1803, addressed to James Hoskin, he made the
farm on the slope of Castell-an-Dinas, from which
height, she says&mdash;</p>

on the head of Mr. Hoskin&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Having heard of the prosperity of those who had
settled in America, he resolved on going thither and
seeing the condition of the farmers in the States and
the quality of the land, so that he might be able to
advise others whether to leave the mother country and
settle there, and with half a mind himself to cast in his
lot with those who were farming there. On his return
he printed, but did not publish, his experience and his
observations. He printed for his own use, and kept a
very few copies for distribution among his relations
and friends. Through the kindness of the Rev. A. C.
Boscawen, Rector of Ludgvan, I have been afforded a
sight of his Narrative. It is interesting as affording a
picture of the condition of the States and the farming
there a century ago. The "Narrative" was printed
by Vigurs, of Penzance, "for the Author" in 1813. In
his preface, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am well aware that in the composition there may
be much room for criticism; to this I answer, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
neither the wish nor qualification to become an <span class="smcap">author</span>,
I need only say I am a <span class="smcap">farmer</span>. This carries its
apology with it, for the book contains plain facts on
agricultural subjects, which I affirm are nearly, if not
perfectly, correct. [I have written nothing designedly
false.] The passage within brackets he cancelled with
his own hand after the book was printed.</p>

<p>"I sailed from Penzance on the 28th of December,
1810, on board an American schooner called the <i>Packet
of Boston</i>, bound for New York with a cargo of iron,
boxes of tin-plate, etc. On leaving the quay the seamen
of a brig gave us three cheers, which we returned.
Soon a number of people on the quay gave us three
more. I asked the men, was it customary on sailing?
They said they had been on the pier two months, but
never saw it done before. So much for cordiality
towards the Americans."</p>

<p>Blood is thicker than water. This is interesting. It
shows that even then, after the States had declared
their independence, and only two years before war was
declared between England and the States, the feeling,
at all events in Cornwall, was one of affection and
regard for the gallant people who had been driven by
stupidity into revolt against the Crown.</p>

<p>After a very rough passage, on the 14th February,
1811, in the depth of winter, the little vessel reached
Vineyard Island. "We soon landed, and put up at
Dr. Spalding's tavern, a handsome house, with good
entertainment and accommodation. Our host was a
doctor, a justice of the peace, a tavern keeper, but quite
the gentleman. The family at meal times sat down
with us&mdash;this is the American fashion. With our tea
we had plenty of beefsteaks, boiled eggs, preserved fruit,
hot cakes, etc. This is customary all over America.
We paid a dollar per day (bed included), but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>
through America we saw nothing of those pests of
beggars, waiters, chambermaids, coachmen, postboys,
etc., which constantly harass and frequently insult the
traveller in England."</p>

<p>On reaching New York he got into trouble with his
captain, who was "slim," and tried to take advantage
of him. "I was detained three weeks by the captain I
came over with from England. I bought at Penzance
some earthenware to carry out. On the passage I sold
the whole to the captain, and had a written agreement
from him to pay me on arriving at New York. At first
he put off the payment for want of money, so on one
pretence or another until he began to unload the vessel,
and then he told me that he had given me no bill of
lading to show the goods were mine, and that I could
not prove them mine. Indeed he did everything in his
power to plunder me of the whole. I then went to the
merchant to whom the cargo was consigned. He was
much hurt at the captain's conduct in attempting to
defraud me, and wrote him a letter immediately. The
next day the merchant called on me, and told me if the
captain did not pay me in half an hour to acquaint him,
but before the half-hour was expired the captain was
come with the money."</p>

<p>From New York Hoskin sailed in the <i>William Eaton</i>
schooner for Alexandria and Washington.</p>

<p>"The captain (being intoxicated) would have the
cook to kill and pick a fowl and dress it in an instant
(the cook was an old man, a negro). The poor man
set about it with all speed, but in the boiling the
captain found fault, caught up the hot fowl and beat
it in the cook's face. The captain confessed that he
had sprung six feet high, and thought he should have
fallen overboard. The captain scalded his three fingers,
etc. Two days after he was full of spite and vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
towards the poor old black man. 'D&mdash;&mdash; the
negroes,' said he, 'I hate them,' and going on deck
beat the poor man dreadfully with pieces of trees cut to
burn, some time after with a rope, and after that with
a fire-shovel. The poor man was very bad all night.
I expected he would have died before morning. Next
morning in that condition he would make him work.
I said, 'Captain, I will attend breakfast; I can do it
better than he.' So I kept him out of the way. In the
afternoon the captain would make the poor creature
come on deck. 'Shall I pay him wages for nothing?'
says he. I told him that the cook could do nothing,
but that I could do much better, and that I would work
for him. In three hours after word was brought to him
that the cook was dying. After he was dead, the captain
came to me and asked what I thought was the
cause of his death, which I turned off."</p>

<p>James Hoskin excuses himself for not trying to bring
the captain to justice. His reasons are not very satisfactory.
First, "it might destroy the happiness of a
dear woman, his wife." In the next place, the mate
would have sworn in the captain's favour; and, finally,
by accusing the captain he would have done no good
to the dead cook.</p>

<p>On ascending the Potomac he was put ashore for a
while.</p>

<p>"I asked at the hut of a white woman for some
water. I shall, while I live, never forget this hut. The
outside was like a stable, built of logs, having no glass
windows. She brought me a bowl of milk, a china
pint to mix water with it. The water stood on a stool
without doors, covered nicely. The hut and everything
within were in such neat order. This milk and water
was as a cordial of wine. I contemplated the happiness
of the farmers in this place, flowing in abundance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
of the first necessaries of life; their wants few and
easily supplied; no cares about raising money for
other people, all being peace, plenty, and happiness
around them."</p>

<p>He ascended the Delaware "in the steem [<i>sic</i>] boat."
The boat was worked by a steam-engine "which turns
round a wheel each side of the boat in the water. It
has wide boards to the end of each spoke, like a water
under-shut wheel. The boat is 100 feet long, wide and
roomy, and a tavern kept on board. The passage
comes very cheap, only 3 dollars for 100 miles, baggage
included."</p>

<p>He tells a story of William Cobbett when in
America. Cobbett conducted a newspaper entitled the
<i>Pesca Post</i> at Philadelphia, and kept a stationer's shop.
He was very outspoken against the French Revolution,
and that did not please the Yankees. One day some
one entered the stationer's shop and asked for some
quills. Cobbett sold them. "Ah, ha!" said the purchaser.
"These be porcupine quills, I guess."
"Porcupine quills they were till I sold them to you,"
was Cobbett's ready answer. "Now they are goose
quills."</p>

<p>"As I was at breakfast one day on Long Island,"
says Hoskin, "there came in a young woman. 'The
English,' said she, 'have pressed my brother in the
Downs; I wish I could guillotine the English, I wish
the English were guillotined.' 'But,' says one in the
room, 'the Christian English will hang a man for
stealing a horse, or stealing a sheep; but for stealing a
man they shall have money.'" Hoskin was too discreet
to bring up the case of the negro slaves and of the
captain and the cook. He saw the first attempt at a
torpedo. A Mr. Fulton had invented one "for the
purpose of sinking it under vessels at anchor and blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
them up. Likewise to anchor under water and
blow up ships coming in a harbour. The Congress
has voted him 6000 dollars to defray the expenses for
making trials, etc. Some time back a day was fixed for
trial at New York, the <i>President</i> a frigate of 44 guns,
and the <i>Argus</i> brig of war lay there; Mr. Fulton chose
to attack the brig, the captain of which prepared for
defence by casting a net round the brig to prevent the
torpedo diving under, and by hanging shot and heavy
weights to the yards and studding sail-booms, to destroy
the torpedo if it came near; but Mr. Fulton could not
succeed at that time; he says he has made vast improvements
since, and shall succeed. This Fulton has a
patent for the steamboats on the Delaware and Hudson
Rivers. They go five miles an hour against wind and
tide."</p>

<p>On his return to England he had a better passage
than on going out. "Then chiefly three or four days
in a week it blew what the sailors call a gale. In the
gale of last week we sailed before the wind, and the
ship rolled much more then than if it was a side wind.
We laughed at supper, though tossed about. We had
cords and bars spread over the table, which was bound
fast to keep the things on it; one held the teapot, and
the mate was desired to bind the tea-kettle with a
string to the side of the cabin. This put me in mind
of last winter's passage. The cook would be called an
hour or two before day to light his fire, and get his
kettle under way, as the phrase is on board; by and by
we should hear the cook on deck crying and swearing,
the sea breaking over having upset the tea-kettle&mdash;the
fire is again lit, and the tea-kettle set on again. Soon
we hear the cook in the like distress, and swearing he
would rather go before the mast than be cook, and so
on. Three times of a morning, one day, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
tea-kettles went overboard; and some days we could
only light fire in the cabin stove, and were obliged to
boil beef in the tea-kettle."</p>

<p>In London, in January, 1803, he had fallen ill, and
thought he had not long to live. This was seven years
before he visited the States, and he then addressed the
following letter to his children:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">

"London, <i>January 13th, 1803</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"My dear Children all and each,</p>

<p>"For the last three days I have found my illness
so to increase, and I am so exceedingly ill at this time,
that I believe it is the Lord's good pleasure that I shall
never see your dear faces again. The God of heaven
take you under His precious, His most special protection
and care. Fear it not my dear sweet loves, but
that good and holy Lord of life and glory will be to
you what He has always been to me&mdash;a father. When
I was about six years old, His good pleasure was to take
my mother. With her I lost I may say my father,
mother and all. But I had a Father in heaven, Who
blessed, watched, and protected me. If you would be
wise, seek true happiness. If you would be happy,
rich and wise, be truly virtuous in word, action, and, as
much as possible, in thought.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Seek virtue, and of that possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave to Providence the rest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"If you will tell a lie, you will tell another; if you
tell two, you will go on further and tell ten, and so on,
to lying on any occasion. If you lie, you will cheat,
when occasion offers you, and so on to other vices.

<h2>JOHN HARRIS, THE MINER POET</h2>


<p>"On the quiet evening of October 14th, 1820,
in a straw-thatched, boulder-built cottage,
with bare rafters and clay floor, locally
known as the 'six chimneys,' on the top
of Bolennowe Hill, Camborne, Cornwall, as the leaves
are falling from the trees, and the robin mourns in the
thicket, a gentle mother gives birth to a babe; and
that baby-boy is a poet."</p>

<p>So John Harris begins his account of his own life.
It is not always safe for a composer of verses to be
too sure that he is a poet, and that his lines will live.
Horace did it,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> so doubtless has many another man
who has hammered out verses; but only Horace was
justified in his prophecy.</p>

   <p class="caption2">JOHN HARRIS, THE MINER POET</p>
</div>

<p>A plum-pudding without plums may be a good suet
dumpling, and without suet also a respectable batter
pudding, but neither is a plum-pudding; and a set of
verses without ideas may be pleasant verses, but is not
poetry; and without ideas and without imagination is
very poor stuff indeed. John Harris could write
smooth lines, he had a tender appreciation of the
beauties of nature, but he went no further. His
verses bear the same relation to poetry that Tupper's
<i>Proverbial Philosophy</i> bears to the Philosophy of Plato.
But to return to his life. He tells us that "from first
to last the majority of my poems have been written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
the open air, in lanes and leas, by old stiles and farm
gates, by rocks and rivers and mossy moors."</p>

<p>He was put to a miserable school where the hedge-school
master was hard-hearted and cruel, and "verily
hoots the lessons in his ears. He beats his pupils
without mercy, with a polished piece of flat wood
studded with small, sharp nails, until the blood runs
down, and soon scares the little learner from his straw-roofed
academy."</p>

<p>From this school he was removed to another after a
few days. "On the edge of a brown common, in a little
thatched school-house by the side of the highway,
very near the famous Nine Maidens, he finds another
master, who wore a wooden leg, with more of the milk
of human kindness in his soul, a thorough Christian,
and a man of prayer." He says further: "You might
have seen him on a summer evening, when his merry
schoolmates are chattering in the hollow&mdash;you might
have seen him walking by the stream, or stretched on
the moss listening to the wind tuning its organ among
the rocks, or gazing up at the purple heavens. He
roams among the flowers, kissing them for very joy,
calling them his fragrant sisters. Born on the crest of
the hill, amid the crags and storms, he grows up in love
with Nature, and she becomes his chief teacher. And
now come the promptings of early genius, which
develop themselves in snatches of unpolished song,
pencilled on the leaves of his copybook for the amusement
of his wondering schoolmates. He often writes
his rhymes on the clean side of cast-off labelled tea-papers
which his mother brings from the shop, and
then reads them to his astonished compeers with rapt
delight."</p>

<p>At the age of nine he was taken from school and put
to work in the fields. At the age of ten he was employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span>
by an old tin-streamer to throw up the sand
from the river, earning threepence a day. At twelve
he was working on the surface "nearly three miles
from his favourite home. As he travels to and fro from
his labour through long lanes bramble covered, and
over meadows snowy with daisies, or by hedges blue
with hyacinths, or over whispering cairns redolent with
the hum of bees&mdash;" he means thyme on which the bees
hover gathering honey&mdash;"the beautiful world around
him teems with syllables of song. Even then he
pencils his strange ditties, reciting them at intervals of
leisure to the dwellers of his own district, and older
heads than his tell of his future fame."</p>

<p>One thing is evident, that at this early age he was
inordinately conceited. He had a true appreciation of
the beauties of Nature. He had a receptive soul, but
it was that which might have made of him a painter,
not necessarily a poet.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen, or as he styles it, "When
thirteen summers have filled his lap with roses, and
fanned his forehead with the breeze of health, we find
him sweating in the hot air of the interior of a mine
(Dolcoath), working with his father nearly two hundred
fathoms below the green fields."</p>

<p>So time passes, and he grows to manhood. Then in
his stilted style he says: "Love meets him on his
flowery pathway, and he weaves a chaplet of the
choicest roses to adorn her head. He worships at the
shrine of beauty till they stand before the sacred altar,
and the two are made one." In plain English, he fell
in love and got married to Jane Rule.</p>

<p>One of his earliest pieces of verse, "The First Primrose,"
got into a magazine, and attracted some little
notice, amongst others that of Dr. George Smith, of
Camborne, who gave him encouragement and induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span>
him to publish. His first book appeared in 1853; soon
after he was appointed Scripture Reader at Falmouth.</p>

<p>He says in his <i>Autobiography</i>: "Soon after my
marriage, the Rev. G. B. Bull, of Treslothian, lent
me a volume of Shakespere. The first play I read
was <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which I greedily devoured,
travelling over a wide down near my father's house.
The delight I experienced is beyond words to describe,
as the sun sank behind the western waters,
and the purple clouds of evening primed the horizon,
the bitters of life changed to sweetness in my cup, and
the wilderness around me was a region of fairies.
Sometimes I cried, sometimes I shouted for joy, and
over the genii-peopled heights a new world burst upon
my view." Next he read <i>Childe Harold</i>, or portions
of it. "My younger brother James possessed an
eighteenpenny copy of Burns' poems, to which I had
access. One day, I was reading Burns in our Troon-Moor
home. No one can tell the ecstasy of my spirit,
or the deep joy of my heart. Not only was I tired with
my mine-work, but also crippled in the quarry raising
stone for the garden-wall. I believe I was in my shirtsleeves,
when a middle-aged matron entered my home.
Seeing a small book before me, she asked what it was.
I told her, and her answer surely displayed her prejudice
and her narrowness of mind. Looking at me
with severity in her features, she exclaimed, 'You ought
to be ashamed of yourself! You, a local preacher, and
reading Burns!' This strange sin put me quite
beyond the reach of her favours, and I do not remember
her ever speaking to me afterwards."</p>

<p>It is an infinite pity that John Harris did not inspire
his muse from Burns; had he done so, his "poems"
might possibly have lived, but <i>poëta nascitur, non fit</i>.</p>

<p>"For more than twenty years I was an underground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>
miner, toiling in the depths of Dolcoath. Here
I laboured from morning till night, and often from
night till morning, frequently in sulphur and dust
almost to suffocation. Sometimes I stood in slime and
water above my knees, and then in levels so badly ventilated
that the very stones were hot, and the rarified
air caused the perspiration to stream into my boots in
rills, though I doffed my flannel shirt and worked
naked to the waist. Sometimes I stood on a stage
hung in ropes in the middle of a wide working, when
my life depended on a single nail driven into a plank.
Had the nail slipped, I should have been pitched headlong
on the broken rocks more than twenty feet below.
Sometimes I stood on a narrow board high up in some
dark working, holding the drill, or smiting it with the
mallet, smeared all over with mineral, so that my
nearest friends would hardly know me, until my hands
ached with the severity of my task, and the blood
dropped off my elbows. Sometimes I had to dig
through the ground where it was impossible to stand
upright, and sometimes to work all day as if standing
to the face of a cliff. Sometimes I have been so exhausted
as to lie down and sleep on the sharp flints."
(There are no flints in Cornish mines.) "And sometimes
so thirsty that I have drunk stale water from the
keg, closing my teeth to keep back the worms. Sometimes
I had wages to receive at the end of the month,
and sometimes I had none. But I despaired not, nor
turned the nymph of song from my side. She murmured
among the tinctured slabs," etc. etc. That
the water brought down from the spring for the use of
the miners was ever full of worms is not to be believed,
nor that he did not receive his regular monthly wages.
John Harris was evidently vastly sorry for himself,
thinking he was born for better things. I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
many a man who has worked underground as a common
miner, without whining and breaking into extravagance
such as this.</p>

<p>"We were at supper one evening in Troon-Moor
house, our two daughters in a window, I at the end of
the kitchen table, and Jane sitting on a chair beside it.
We had fried onions, and the flavour was very agreeable.
I was hungry, having just returned from a long
day's labour in the mine. Suddenly we heard a step
in the garden, and then a knock at the door. My wife
opened it, and I heard a gruff voice say, 'Does the
young Milton live here?' My wife asked the possessor
of the gruff voice to walk in; and we soon discovered
that it was the Rev. G. Collins. We invited him to
partake of our meal, to which he at once assented, eating
the onions with a spoon, exclaiming at almost
every mouthful, 'I like fried leeks.' He asked for my
latest production, and I gave him 'The Child's First
Prayer,' in MS. He quietly read it, and before he had
finished I could see the tears streaming down his face.
Besides the two daughters, Jane and Lucretia, already
named, we were afterwards blest with two sons,
Howard and Alfred."</p>

<p>I have given this passage from the <i>Autobiography</i> of
John Harris with pleasure, as it exhibits the author at
his best. Whether the tears may not have been an
adjunct of his fancy, I do not pretend to say. When
he writes simple English, concerning his own life and
experiences, he is always interesting, but when he
steps up into his florid car, as a chauffeur at the Battle
of Roses at Nice, he is intolerable.</p>

<p>"Throughout my mining life I have had several
narrow escapes from sudden death. Once when at the
bottom of the mine, the bucket-chains suddenly severed
and came roaring down the shaft with rocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
rubbish. I and my comrade had scarcely time to
escape; and one of the smaller fragments of stone
cut open my forehead, leaving a visible scar to this
day. Then the man-engine accidentally broke, hurling
twenty men headlong into the pit, and I amongst them.
A few scars and bruises were my only injuries. Standing
before a tin-stepe on the smallest foothold, a thin
piece of flint (?), air-impelled, struck me on the face,
cutting my lips and breaking some of my front teeth.
Had I fallen backwards among the huge slabs" (the
rock does not form slabs) "death must have been instantaneous.
Passing over a narrow plank, a hole
exploded at my feet, throwing a shower of stones
around me, but not a hair of my head was injured."</p>

<p>"A more wonderful interposition of Divine Providence
may be traced, perhaps, in the following record.
Our party consisted of five men working in a sink.
Two of them were my younger brothers. Over our
heads the ground was expended, and there was a huge
cavern higher and further than the light of the candle
would reveal. Here hung huge rocks as if by hairs (!)
and we knew it not. We were all teachers in a
Sunday-school, and on the tea-and-cake anniversary
remained out of our working to attend the festival.
Some men who laboured near us, at the time when
we were in the green field singing hymns, heard a
fearful crash in our working, and on hastening to see
what it was found the place full of flinty (?) rocks.
They had suddenly fallen from above, exactly in the
place where we should have been, and would have
crushed us to powder were it not for the Sunday-school
treat."</p>

<p>Moving in his little circle, surrounded by the
ignorant, it is no wonder that John Harris was puffed
up with vanity, and thought himself a poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span></p>

<p>He was very urgent in the promotion of the cause
of peace and arbitration between nations, and wrote
a series of tracts entitled <i>Peace Pages</i>, of which some
hundreds of thousands were distributed, and produced
as much effect on the policy of nations as waste paper.
In the year 1864 a prize was offered for the best poem
on the tercentenary of the birth of Shakespeare. It
was competed for by over a hundred persons in Great
Britain and America. Mr. Harris gained the prize,
and was presented with a gold watch. It is not
possible to estimate its value, poetically, without a
knowledge of the "poems" that failed, and the discrimination
of the judges.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> From first to last John
Harris published no less than sixteen volumes of verse.
He died in 1884, and was buried in Treslothian Churchyard,
near Camborne. He had received a grant of
£50 per annum from the Royal Literary Fund, 1872-75,
and £200 from the Royal Bounty Fund in 1877.</p>

<p>He had a son, John Alfred Harris, born at Falmouth
in 1860, who became a wood engraver, working in a
recumbent position owing to a spinal affliction. He
illustrated some of his father's works. Another son,
James Howard Harris, born in 1857, became master
of the Board School, Porthleven, and wrote a memoir
of his father.</p>

<p>John Harris had the faculty of receiving impressions
from the objects of nature, as does a mirror, but had
no power to give forth flashes of genius, for of genius
he had none. His verses read smoothly and pleasantly,
but will not live, as there is no vital spark in
them. He stands, however, on a higher level than
Edward Capern, the Devonshire postman "poet," but
immeasurably below Burns and Waugh.</p>

<p>He published, moreover, a series of addresses, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>
all marked with the same paucity of idea, lack of
original thought. A good but very self-satisfied man,
he reaped far higher applause in his day as he deserved,
and in another generation will be clean forgotten. He
called himself the miner poet, but he is not even a
minor poet. There is something pathetic in the contemplation
of a man of this sort. I have come across
several instances&mdash;men who have a love of nature, an
appreciation of the beautiful and the good and the
true, but have no genius, no originality, who can
imitate but create nothing. It is the same with
musicians. There are a thousand who can write songs,
but only one in a thousand who can produce a pure
melody. The mirror reflects objects, but the burning-glass
focusses the sun's rays in a pencil of fire that
kindles whatever it falls on. Such is the difference
between the versifier and the poet.</p>

<h2>EDWARD CHAPMAN</h2>


<p>Hals tells the following story of Mr. Edward
Chapman, of Constantine. But before
giving it, it will be well to say a few
words of the Chapman family. The name
suffices to show that it was not Cornish by origin, and
indeed in the <i>Heralds' Visitation</i> it is recorded to have
come from the North. Why they came down one
cannot say, but they married well. One John Chapman,
of Harpford, in Devon, had to wife a daughter of
Chichester, of Hall, and his son Edward married a
Prideaux, and settled at Resprin in S. Winnow, and
as that was a manor that belonged to the Prideaux
family it is probable that his wife was an heiress.
Edward, the grandson, baptized at S. Winnow
May 12th, 1647, was probably the person mentioned
by Hals, to whom the adventure is attributed. He
was married to a daughter of Bligh, of Botathen.</p>

<p>"This gentleman received from God's holy angels a
wonderful preservation in the beginning of the reign
of William III when returning from Redruth towards
his own house about seven miles distant, with his
servant, late at night, and both much intoxicated with
liquor (as himself told me); nevertheless having so
much sense left as to consider that they were to pass
through several tin mines or shafts near the highway,
on the south-east side of Redruth town, alighted both
from their horses, and led them in their hands after
them. The servant went somewhat before his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>
the better to keep the right road in those places, which
occasioned Mr. Chapman's turning aside somewhat
out of the way, whereby in the dark he suddenly fell
into a tin mine above twenty fathoms deep, at whose
fall into this precipice his horse started back and
escaped; in this pit or hole Mr. Chapman fell directly
down fifteen fathoms without let or intermission, where
meeting with a cross drift (above six fathoms of water
under it), he in his campaign coat, sword, and boots,
was miraculously stopped, when, coming to himself,
he was not much sensible of any hurt or bruises he had
received, through the terror and horror of his fall;
when, considering in what condition he was, he
resolved to make the best expedient he could to
prevent his falling further down (where, by the
dropping of stones and earth moved by his fall, he
understood there was much water under), so he rested
his back against one side of the ruin, and his feet
against the other, athwart the hole, and in order to fix
his hands on some solid thing, drew his sword out of
its sheath, and thrust the blade thereof as far as he
could into the opposite part of the shaft, and so in
great pain and terror rested himself.</p>

<p>"The suddenness of this accident, and the horse's
escaping in the dark as aforesaid, was the reason why
Mr. Chapman's servant, who went before him, did not
so soon find him wanting as otherwise he might, which
as soon as he did, he went back the roadway in quest
of him, calling him aloud by his name; but receiving
no answer, nor being able to find his horse, he concluded
his master had rode home some other way,
whereupon, giving up all further search after him, he
hastened home to Constantine, expecting to have met
him there; but contrary to his expectations, found he
was not returned. Whereupon his servants, early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>
next morning, went forth to inquire after him, and
suspecting (as it happened) he might be fallen into
some tin-shafts about Redruth, hastened thither, where,
before they arrived, some tinners had taken custody
of his horse (with bridle and saddle on), which they
found grazing in the Wastsell Downs. Whereupon,
consulting together about this tragical mishap, it was
resolved forthwith that some of these tinners, for
reward, should search the most dangerous shafts in
order to find his body, either living or dead; accordingly
they employed themselves that day till about
four o'clock in the afternoon without any discovery of
him. Finally, one person returned to his company,
and told them that at a considerable distance he heard
a kind of human voice underground; to which place
they repaired, and making loud cries to the hole of
the shaft, he forthwith answered them that he was
there alive, and prayed their assistance in order to
deliver him from that tremendous place; whereupon,
immediately they set on tackle ropes and
windlass on the old shaft, so that a tinner descended
to the place where he rested, and having candle-light
with him, bound him fast in a rope, and so drew him
safely to land, where, to their great admiration and
joy, it appeared he had neither broke any bone, or was
much bruised by the fall; verifying that old English
proverb, that drunkards seldom take hurt; for, as the
tinners said, if he had fallen but two or three feet
lower, he must inevitably have been drowned in the
water. But maugre all these adverse accidents, after
about seventeen hours' stay in the pit aforesaid, he
miraculously escaped death, and lived many years
after, and would recount this story with as much pleasure
as men do the ballads of 'Chevy Chase' or
'Rosamond Clifford.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span></p>




<h2>JOHN COKE, OF TRERICE</h2>


<p>There is no thriving on ill-gotten goods,
says the proverb, and this was exemplified
in the case of the Cook or Coke family of
Trerice, in S. Allen.</p>

<p>According to Hals, John Coke, attorney-at-law, came
into these parts of Cornwall in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth from Ottery S. Mary, in Devon, "without
money or goods, and placed himself a servant or
steward under Sir Francis Godolphin, Knight, where
he began from, and with, his ink-horn and pen, to
turn all things that he touched into gold, and that by
indirect art and practices as tradition saith." This
Cook or Coke derived from a Henry Cooke, a citizen
of Exeter, who married the sister and heiress of Roger
Thorne, in Ottery S. Mary; and the eldest branch of
the family remained at Thorne till the end of the
seventeenth century, when it became extinct.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Godolphin, finding John Coke a clever
business man, left in his hands the management of his
estate and his tin mines.</p>

<p>Coke took care that all the tin of his master's mines
should be run into blocks and stamped with the dolphin,
to show whence they came and whose they were. But
after a while, as he saw that he was not specially overlooked,
and that opportunity was afforded him for
peculation, he had a considerable share of the block
tin produced at the blowing-houses of Sir Francis for
himself, and to distinguish it from that of his master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
had it stamped with the figure of a cat, as cats are on
the Coke arms; and this he disposed of to his own
advantage, and eventually it was found that from the
Godolphin mines more tin was produced and sold
marked with the cat than was with the dolphin.</p>

<p>Hals says: "Sir Francis's lady being informed of
his ill practices, and resolving by the next coinage to
be better instructed in this mystery, at such time as
Godolphin blowing-house was at work, privately, with
one of her maids, in a morning, on foot went to that
place, where according, as common fame reported, she
found many more blocks or slabs of tin marked with
the cat than there were with the dolphin; the one part
pertaining to Sir Francis, the other to Mr. Coke.
Whereupon, abundantly satisfied, she returned to
Godolphin House, but could not be there timely
enough against dinner; whereat Sir Francis was
greatly distasted, having at that time several strangers
to dine with him. At length the lady being arrived,
she asked all their pardons for her absence, and told
them it did not proceed from any neglect or want of
respect, but from an absolute necessity of seeing a
strange and unheard-of piece of curiosity, which could
not be seen at any other time; viz. to see a cat eat the
dolphin. And then gave an account of the premises,
to their great wonder and admiration; whereupon,
soon after, Sir Francis dismissed him from his service.
But by that time he had gotten so much riches that
forthwith he purchased the little barton and manor of
Trerice, in S. Allen, and made that place his habitation
till he purchased the barton and manor of
Tregasa, and seated himself there, where, by parsimony
and the inferior practice of the law, he accumulated
a very considerable estate in those parts. But
maugre all his thrift and conduct in providing wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
for himself and posterity, his grandson, Thomas Coke,
succeeding to his estate, upon the issueless decease of
his elder brother, Christopher Coke, and buying in his
widow's jointure at a dear rate, and also undertaking
the building of the present new and finely contrived
house at Tregasa, though never finished, yet the said
fabric was so costly and chargeable to him, together
with the vain extravagance of his wife Lance, that he
was necessitated to sell divers parcels of lands in order
to raise money for his necessary occasions, and finally
to mortgage the manor and barton of Tregasa and
all his other lands that were before unsold, for about
fourteen thousand pounds, to Hugh Boscawen, of
Tregothnan, Esq.; and lastly, for that consideration
and others, did, by lease and release, fine and proclamation,
convey the same to the said Hugh Boscawen,
his heirs and assigns, for ever. Soon after this fact
Mr. Coke fell into great want and distress, together
with his wife and children, and died suddenly by a slip
of his foot into a shallow pit, wherein he was searching
for tin, out of a conceited opinion he had that he
should at last raise his fortune by tin, as his grandfather
before him had done."</p>

<p>What Hals has omitted to state is that John Coke
married a Godolphin, Prudence, daughter of William
Godolphin, of Trewarveneth, by whom he had three
sons&mdash;John, Edward, and Francis. Thomas Coke,
who came to such grief, the sins of the grandfather
visited on the grandchild, was Sheriff of Cornwall in
the year 1651 under the Commonwealth.</p>

<h2>THOMAS PELLOW, OF PENRYN</h2>


<p>Thomas Pellow was born at Penryn, in
all probability in 1704, and was educated in
the Latin school of that place. But loving
adventure better than books, and impatient
to escape <i>propria quæ maribus</i>, he implored his uncle
John Pellow to allow him to embark with him in the
good ship <i>Francis</i>, owned by Valentine Enys, merchant,
of Penryn, that was bound with a cargo of
pilchards for Genoa. He soon began to regret having
left the school bench, for his uncle not only made him
work as a common seaman, but when not so employed
held him to those hated books, and if he shirked, gave
him the cat-o'-nine-tails. "So that by the time we got
to Genoa I thought I had enough of the sea, being
every day, during our voyage out, obliged (over and
above my book learning) to go up to the main-top
mast-head, even in all weather." On the return
voyage when off Cape Finisterre the vessel was captured
by Sallee pirates, and it with the crew conveyed
to Morocco as captives. Thomas Pellow was in but his
eleventh year, and his Moorish masters thought that
they would have little difficulty with him in making of
him a Mussulman.</p>

<p>He remained in Morocco for twenty-three years,
during which time he kept a diary, and this was published
in London in 1739 and 1740, but no date is
affixed to the two editions. A third edition was published
in 1775, and recently his record of adventure has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
been included in the "Adventure Series," edited with
an introduction by Dr. Robert Brown, and published
by Mr. Fisher Unwin, London, 1890. In this edition
the narrative extends to 330 pages, and it is not my intention
to give even a summary of its contents, the
book itself being easily accessible. What must suffice
is some account of the beginning of his bondage and
an idea of the condition of Morocco whilst he was
there.</p>

<p>Thomas Pellow was given as slave to Muley Spha
one of the Sultan's favourite sons, but, as Pellow says,
a sad villain. "My business now was to run from
morning to night after his horse's heels; during which
he often prompted me to turn Moor, and told me, if I
would, I should have a very fine horse to ride on, and I
should live like one of his best esteemed friends." As
Pellow declined this invitation, "he committed me
prisoner to one of his own rooms, keeping me there
several months in irons, and every day most severely
bastinading me.... My tortures were now exceedingly
increased, burning my flesh off my bones by
fire; which the tyrant did, by frequent repetitions, insomuch,
that through my so very acute pains I was at
last constrained to submit, calling upon God to forgive
me, who knows that I never gave the consent of the
heart, though I seemingly yielded by holding up my
finger."</p>

<p>He was then, after having been instructed in the
Moorish language, appointed to be chief porter to the
Sultan's harem, where resided the Sultana and thirty-eight
concubines. He received strict orders that no
one should be admitted without due notice. On one
occasion the Sultan arrived and knocked to be admitted
without having previously intimated his intention of
paying a visit to his harem. The outer porter made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
difficulty in admitting him, but Thomas Pellow absolutely
refused to admit His Majesty as he had received
no notice that he was coming, and when the Sultan
continued to knock, he discharged his blunderbuss
through the door. The Sultan was so delighted at his
trustworthy character and behaviour on the occasion,
that he cut off the heads of the two complaisant door-keepers,
and promoted Pellow to be one of his bodyguard.</p>

<p>After a few years the Sultan, "being on the merry
fun, ordered to be brought before him eight hundred
young men, and soon after as many young women, and
he told the men, that he had on several occasions
observed their readiness in obeying him, he would
therefore give every one of them a wife; and which
indeed, he soon did, by giving some by his own hand
(a very great condescension), and to others by the
beckoning of his head, and the cast of his eye, where
they should fix. After they were all coupled and
departed, I was also called forth, and bid to look at
eight black women standing there, and to take one of
them for a wife, at which sudden command, I (being
not a little confounded) immediately bowing twice, falling
to the ground and kissing it, and after that the
Emperor's foot, humbly entreated him that he would be
graciously pleased to give me one of my own colour.
Then, forthwith sending them off, he ordered to be
brought forth seven others, who all proved to be
mulattoes, at which I again bowed to the ground, still
entreating him to give me one of my own colour; and
then he ordered them also to depart, and sent for a
single woman, full dressed, with two blacks attending
her. I being forthwith ordered to take her by the hand
and lead her off, perceived it to be black also, as soon
after I did her feet; at which I started back, and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
asked what was the matter, I answered him as before;
when he, assenting, ordered me to lift up her veil and look
at her face; which I readily obeying, found her to be of
a very agreeable complexion, the old rascal crying out
in the Spanish language, <i>Bono, bono</i>, ordering me a
second time to take her by the hand, lead her off, and
keep her safe."</p>

<p>By this wife Pellow had a daughter. The Sultan
was a monster of cruelty, but according to Pellow there
was not much choice in rotten apples; he saw the rise of
several, and one was as bad as another. He says of the
first he served: "He was of so fickle, cruel, and
sanguine a nature, that none could become for one hour
secure of life. He had many despatched, by having
their heads cut off, or by being strangled, others by
tossing; but scarce would he on those occasions afford
a verbal command, he thinking that too much&mdash;generally
giving it by signs or motions of his head and
hand.</p>

<p>"The punishment of <i>Tossing</i> is a very particular one
and peculiar to the Moors. The person whom the
Emperor orders to be thus punished is seized by three
or four strong negroes, who, taking hold of his arms,
throw him up with all their strength, and at the same
time turning him round, pitch him down head foremost;
at which they are so dexterous by long use, that they
can either break his neck at the first toss, dislocate his
shoulder, or let him fall with less hurt. They continue
doing this as often as the Emperor has ordered.</p>

<p>"The Emperor's wrath is terrible, which the Christians
have often felt. One day, passing by a high wall
on which they were at work, and being affronted that
they did not keep time in their strokes, he made the
guards go up and throw them off the wall, breaking
their legs and arms, and knocking them on the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>
Another time he ordered them to bury a man alive, and
beat him down along with the mortar in the wall.</p>

<p>"In the year 1721 the Emperor despatched El Arbi
Shat, a man of one of the best families in Barbary,
being descended from the Andalusian Moors, and
deserved the esteem both of his own countrymen and of
us. Part of the crime laid to his charge was for going
out of the country without the Emperor's knowledge,
and having been friendly himself with Christian women,
and often been in liquor. He was also accused of being
an unbeliever. Early one morning he was carried
before the Emperor, who commanded him to be sawed
in two; upon which he was tied between two boards and
sawed in two, beginning at the head and going downwards,
till the body fell asunder, and must have
remained to have been eaten by dogs, if the Emperor
had not pardoned him&mdash;an extravagant custom, to
pardon a man after he is dead, but unless he does so,
nobody dares bury the body."</p>

<p>Pellow describes the condition of the Christian
slaves: "The severest labour and hardships inflicted
on malefactors in Europe are levity compared with what
many worthy persons undergo in this modern Egypt.
At daybreak the guardians of the several dungeons,
where the Christian slaves are shut up at night, rouse
them with curses and blows to their work, which consists
in providing materials for the Emperor's extravagant
buildings, stamping earth mixed with lime and water, in
a wooden box near three yards long and three feet
deep, and of the extended breadth of the wall. Their
instrument for this is a heavy wooden stamper.
Others prepare and mix the earth, or dig in quarries
for lime stones; others burn them. Some are employed
to carry large baskets of earth; some drive wagons
drawn by six bulls and two horses, and, after the toil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span>
the day, these miserable carters watch their cattle in the
field at night, and in all weathers, as their life must
answer for any accident. The task of many is to saw,
cut, cement and erect marble pillars, and of such as are
found qualified, to make gunpowder and small arms;
yet does not their skill procure them any better treatment
than those who, having only the use of their
limbs without any ingenuity, are set to the coarsest
works, as tending horses, sweeping stables, carrying
burdens, grinding with hand-mills. They have all
their respective taskmasters, who punish the least
stop or inadvertency, and often will not allow the poor
creatures time to eat their bread. After such a wearisome
day, it frequently happens they are hurried away to some
filthy work in the night time. Their lodgings in the
night are subterranean dungeons, round, and about five
fathoms diameter and three deep, going down by a
ladder of ropes, which is afterwards drawn up, and an
iron grate fastened in the mouth; and here they lay
upon mats. Neither has their fare anything more comfortable
in it, consisting only of a small platter of black
barley meal, with a pittance of oil per day. This
scantiness has put several upon hazarding a leap from
very high walls only to get a few wild onions that grow
in the Moors' burying place."</p>

<p>Pellow developed considerable military ability and
was employed in military operations against rebels; he
was made a captain, and was present at several sieges,
and witnessed the barbarity wherewith were treated the
men of a captured town. On one occasion the troops
were required to cut off the heads of all the male inhabitants
and bring them to the Sultan; but as the
number was so great and the stench threatened to breed
a pestilence in the army, the general was compelled to
slice off the ears and pickle them in barrels and convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>
these only to the Sultan at his capital, who graciously
under the circumstances accepted the ears in lieu of the
heads.</p>

<p>Pellow was several times wounded, and he made occasional
abortive attempts to escape. When wounded,
returning from one of his expeditions, he received news
that his wife and daughter were dead, and he calmly
observes: "I must own that it gave me very little
uneasiness, as I thought them to be by far better off
than they could have been in this troublesome world,
especially this part of it; and I was really very glad
that they were delivered out of it, and therefore it gave
me very little uneasiness."</p>

<p>It is startling to think that in the reign of George I
there should be such numbers of English as well as
French, Spanish and Italian captives in Morocco and
Algiers and Tunis, and that their redemption should
have to be the work of private charity, and not be a
determined undertaking of Government.</p>

<p>In 1791 England framed a treaty with Morocco giving
our merchants freedom to sail the seas unmolested, and
permitting renegades to return to their old faith and
obtain their liberty on certain conditions. But captives
continued to be taken by the corsairs as of old: "Shall
a Moslem," asked one of the sultans, "be a slave to
his word, like a dog of a Christian?" In 1800 Muley
Suliman agreed with Spain for a reciprocal interchange
of captives, and similar contracts were entered into
with other powers. In 1817, acting under <i>force
majeure</i>, Suliman was compelled to disarm his war
vessels, and promise to put an end to this atrocious
system, that had lasted too long. But although piracy
was no longer officially recognized, it did not wholly
cease. Whether the Sultan connived at the infraction
of treaty, or whether the inhabitants of the Riff shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
acted independently of him, merchant vessels continued
to be boarded and taken and the crew enslaved.</p>

<p>In 1828 the English established a blockade of the
Morocco coast in retaliation for the continuance of these
outrages, and in 1829 the capture of an Austrian vessel
by pirates led to the bombardment of the ports of
Tetuan, Azila, Rabat, and Sallee. At length the
insolence of the Moorish corsairs led to the Spanish
war of 1859-60, which taught the Moors a salutary
lesson.</p>

<p>In 1856 Sir John Drummond-Hay succeeded in
recovering some captives, and in exacting an assurance
that similar conduct should not recur. But although
attacks by piratical ships on the high seas were brought
to an end, wrecking was pursued with zest and
impunity. Any vessel that was cast upon the coast
was regarded as a legitimate prize, and its crew who
came ashore were carried into the interior and enslaved.
In this way Riley, Adams, and Puddock were able to
write their experiences, on their escape from captivity.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Brook in 1831 wrote that "the country
Moors on all parts of the coast are constantly on the
look out for Christians, and instantly make prisoners
of all who have either landed accidentally or have been
shipwrecked. Parties that are occasionally formed, as
ours was, to visit Cape Spartel are even subject to this,
and in one recent instance the lady of the English Vice-Consul,
who had strolled to a short distance out of sight
of the guard that attended her, was on the point of
being made a prisoner by a body of natives who
surrounded her and her party, thinking they were alone,
until undeceived by the timely appearance of the
escort."</p>

<p>A visitor to the Riviera will see the little towns and
villages walled up, and with strong gateways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span>
towers. They were protections against Algerine and
Moroccan corsairs, who would land and raid the coast
for captives; and there are old men still living who had
heard from their fathers piteous stories of their being
taken and carried off into bondage and cruel slavery in
Africa.</p>

<p>There are still, and there have been in the past,
numerous Europeans who have been renegades, and
have lent their wits and experience to the Moors, but
they are nearly all scoundrels of the worst description,
<i>forçats</i> who have escaped from the prisons in Spain
or Algiers, and other vagabonds unable to show their
faces in Europe. Dr. Brown writes: "I know of no
British renegade&mdash;the last and the most respectable of
the order, a Scotchman, who lived at Rabat, much
esteemed for his intelligence and honourable conduct,
having died two years ago. Were the history of these
turncoats fully known, the story of their lives would be
a curious chapter in the annals of human nature. One
of the most romantic of these tales was that of an old
white-bearded man who, when the French military
commission first entered Fez in 1877, was seen silently
and sad-eyed, supported by two attendants, contemplating
a uniform with which in days gone by he was
very familiar. This aged renegade was known as Abd-er-Rhuman;
but his christened name was Count Joseph
de Saulty, formerly a lieutenant of engineers in the army
of Algeria. In a weak moment he eloped with the
commandant's wife, and remained in Tunis until she
died. Then, becoming painfully anxious of the grave
position in which he was placed as a deserter from the
colours, he passed into Morocco, changed his faith,
and as a military adviser of the then Sultan rose high
in the imperial favour. He died in 1881, and is buried
at the gates of Fez, though so thoroughly did he put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span>
the past behind him, that his son, now occupying a high
position in the Court, is entirely ignorant of any language
except Arabic. Another renegade of note was
the English officer still remembered as Inglis Bashaw
under whom Muley-el-Hassan, the present Sultan,
learned the art of war, and who was the first individual
to impart anything like discipline to the Moroccan
army. Why he came to Morocco is not known, and so
jealously was his identity kept dark, that in a recent
work by the Viscount de la Montonère his real name is
declared to be unknown. At this date there can be no
reason for concealing that it was Graham; and I have
been told by those who have every reason to know that,
like so many others who incur the jealousy of the
Moorish dignitaries, he died of poison."</p>

<p>The time of Morocco piracy is at an end, but that on
land there are still captures has been of late years but
too evident&mdash;the last being the capture of Sir Hugh
Maclean.</p>

<p>But to return to Thomas Pellow.</p>

<p>After several ineffectual attempts at escape, and after
incurring hairbreadth escapes, Pellow succeeded eventually
in making his way to Gibraltar. But even there
he was not safe. A Jew, agent for the Sultan of
Morocco, claimed him, and demanded that he should be
surrendered, as a Mussulman and as a subject of the
Moorish Sultan. But General Field-Marshal Joseph
Sabine, then Governor of Gibraltar, answered peremptorily
that, as an English-born subject, he was an
Englishman, and could not be surrendered. He went
on board a vessel for England and reached Deptford,
"and going on shore, directly to the church, returned
public thanks to God for my safe arrival in Old
England."</p>

<p>He remained in Deptford, very kindly received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
a brother Cornishman, William Jones, and there, finding
no vessel bound for Falmouth, he went to London
and thence embarked on board a vessel commanded by
Captain Francis, who readily offered him a passage to
Truro.</p>

<p>He landed at Falmouth. The news of his coming
had spread. "My father's house was almost quite at
the other end of the town. I was, before I could reach
it, more than an hour; for notwithstanding it was
almost dark, I was so crowded by the inhabitants that I
could not pass through them without a great deal of
difficulty&mdash;every one bidding me welcome home, being
all very inquisitive with me if I knew them, which,
indeed I did not, for I was so very young at my
departure, and my captivity and the long interval of
time had made so very great an alteration on both sides,
that I did not know my own father and mother, nor
they me; and had we happened to meet at any other
place without being preadvised, whereby there might
be an expectation or natural instinct interposing, we
should no doubt have passed each other, unless my
great beard might have influenced them to inquire
further after me."</p>

<p>He returned to Penryn on the 15th October, 1738, his
birthday.</p>

<p>His narrative concludes with a touching account of
his gratitude to God for having brought him back, and
an expression of his earnest desire to serve God truly
all the rest of his days upon earth.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE ROBARTES
FAMILY</h2>

<p>Colonel Symonds, who accompanied
Charles I when he was in the West, says
in his diary: "A gentleman of the county
told me the original of the Lord Roberts
his family. His great-grandfather was servant to a
gentleman of this county&mdash;his hynd. Afterwards lived
in Truro, and traded in wood and fferzen&mdash;got an estate
of 5 to £600. His son was so bred, and lived there too,
putt out his money, and his debtors paid it him in tynn.
He engrossing the sale of tyn, grew to be worth many
thousands&mdash;£30,000. His son was squeezed by the
Court in King James his time of £20,000, so was made
a Baron, and built the house of Lanhydrock, now the
seat of Lord Roberts" (pp. 45, 46). The hind, who
founded the family, and sold wood and furze for the tin
smelting, was Richard Roberts of Truro, who married
Joan Geffrey of S. Breage, and died in 1593. His son,
who continued the wood store and got paid in tin, was
John Roberts, who married Philippa, daughter of John
Gaverigan, of a very ancient family. He died in 1615.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of coal in tin smelting, the
fuel employed was peat, furze, i.e. gorse that produced
a quick, fierce blaze, and wood. Rapidly the trees in
Cornwall were disappearing, as the produce of tin ore
became greater, and the lack of the necessary fuel was
becoming a serious impediment.</p>

His Ma<sup>ties</sup> most Hon<sup>ble</sup>. Privy Council. Año·1683</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span></p>

<p>Carew, speaking of the woods in Cornwall, when he
compiled his Survey, says that in the west of the county
they were scarce, and the few that were preserved were
principally employed in making charcoal for the blowing-houses.
"This lacke," he adds, "they supply
either with steam-coal from Wales, or dried turfes,
some of which are also converted into coal to serve the
tinners' turne."</p>

<p>From the charters of King John and Edward I we
learn that power was granted to the tinners to take turf
and wood where they could for the purpose of smelting
the ore; but as the woods disappeared, and the turf
was being used up in the neighbourhood of the works,
they could not travel to great distances to procure the
needful fuel. Richard Roberts saw his opportunity
and seized it. He made contracts with the owners of
coppices and furzy downs and peat bottoms, and
gathered his supplies in one great store at Truro. He
did more&mdash;he obtained coals from Wales, and sold to
the mining adventurers at a handsome profit to himself,
thus saving them the waste of time in wandering about
obtaining fuel where they could. Thus he laid the
foundations of a business that was largely increased by
his son John. But this latter embarked on another
branch of money-making. He lent cash to the adventurers
in the mines. "As poor as a tinner" was a proverbial
expression in Cornwall, and "a tinner is never
broke till his back is broke." But if the working miner
remained poor, the moneylender waxed wealthy on the
miners' work.</p>

<p>Carew observes that the parishes in which the tin
was worked were in a "meaner plight of wealth" than
those which were agricultural. Vast amounts of tin
were raised, but little of the profit stuck to the hands of
the toilers in the mines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span></p>

<p>Tinning was not carried on by large companies, but
by small men; three or four would combine to take a
set. They cut four turves at the bounds, paying a certain
sum down to the Duchy or to the private owner of the
land, as rent; and also owing a toll of the tin raised to
the proprietor of the land. These small men were
without capital, and they were constrained to borrow of
Roberts, and he let them have the requisite money at a
rate of interest we should consider extortionate. Queen
Elizabeth was unable to borrow money of the estates of
Holland under 25 per cent, and we may judge what
would be the rate of interest demanded by the usurer
of the working miner.</p>

<p>But that was not all. The miner did not pay the
interest in cash, but in tin, and tin at the value pretty
arbitrarily laid down by the moneylender, so that he
had the adventurer in two ways. Nor was this indeed all.
He often advanced to the miner not cash alone, but the
tools for his trade, the timber for shoring up the shafts,
and the machinery, such as it was, for pumping the
water out of the mines.</p>

<p>There was an additional means of getting money,
and also of acquiring lands. Carew gives us a curious
account of the manner in which the London merchants
of his time took advantage of any want of money
Cornish gentry in London might experience in order
to defray their expenses there, by binding them to
furnish tin for money advanced, at great ultimate loss
to the Cornish men. They also had their agents in
Cornwall, who advanced money to the needy tinners,
partly in wares and partly in money, upon agreement
that they should furnish certain quantities of tin at the
next coinage, by which the tinners experienced great
loss.</p>

<p>With regard to the loans to the adventurers, Roberts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</a></span>
possessed the inestimable advantage of being on the
spot, and so prepared to supply them with the
fuel and the capital they needed. But there were
Cornish gentry who wanted to go to London, and
desired loans to cover their expenses in town.
They went to Roberts: he furnished the supplies.
As may be well expected, these gentry did not make
money in London, they became greatly impoverished
there, and Roberts, we may infer, was able to take their
estates, or large slices out of them, on the security of
which he had made the advances.</p>

<p>How hard the work of the poor tinners was, on whom
the usurers preyed, we learn from Carew. "In most
places," he says, "their toyle is so extream, as they
cannot endure it above four hours a day, but are
succeeded by spels; the residue of the time they weare
out at coytes, kayles, or like idle exercises."</p>

<p>Richard Roberts, the son of John, amassed great
wealth, and was knighted 11 November, 1616. At this
time he was threatened with prosecution by the Privy
Seal for usury, and he only escaped trial by paying a
bribe of £12,000. He bought a baronetcy of James I
in 1621, and was created Baron Truro in 1625. One of
the charges brought against Buckingham, when impeached
in the House of Commons, was that he had
received a bribe of £10,000 from Richard Roberts for
negotiating for him his elevation to the Barony of
Truro. This is confirmed by the deposition of Roberts
himself (<i>Calendar State Papers</i>, 1677-8, p. 220; cf.
1625-6, p. 298).</p>

<p>Richard Roberts married Frances, daughter of John
Hender of Botreux Castle or Boscastle, a co-heiress,
and died in 1634. He was evidently a very shrewd and
grasping man, and particularly desirous of pushing
ahead and obtaining a position to which his only claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span>
was wealth. By the marriages of father and son, the
very plebeian family of Roberts brought strains of
gentle blood into the veins of their descendants. He
it was who built the stately mansion of Lanhydrock.
He died 19th April, 1634, but was not buried at Lanhydrock
till July 4th in the same year.</p>

<p>His son and heir John Roberts, second Baron Truro,
was sent to be educated at Exeter College, Oxford. He
entered as Gentleman Commoner in 1625, when aged
seventeen, the year of his mother's death. At college,
according to Wood, he "sucked in evil principles both
as to Church and State."</p>

<p>By his marriage with the Lady Lucy, daughter of
Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick, he became allied to the
leaders of the opposition among the peers, and during
the Long Parliament his vote was almost always given
with the popular party among the Lords. He was
appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall in 1642, and
became colonel of a regiment of foot in the army of
Lord Essex. He fought at Edgehill, and commanded
a brigade in the battle of Newbury. In 1644 he held
the position of Field Marshal in the army of Essex,
and he was with him in the west when he advanced
further into Cornwall, getting into a position which
eventually led to a humiliating defeat, among a population
fanatically affected to the Royal side.</p>

<p>The King with Prince Maurice was in full pursuit,
driving him into a corner, the narrow extremity of
Cornwall. The King was now joined by Sir Richard
Grenville with Cornish levies, cutting off some of the
Parliamentarian foraging parties. But the sea as yet
was open, and the Earl of Warwick, who attended the
motions of the army, was off the coast. "It was therefore
now resolved to make Essex's quarters yet straiter,
and to cut off even his provisions by sea, or a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span>
part thereof." Fowey was in the possession of Essex,
"and it was exceedingly wondered at by all men, that
he being so long possessed of Foy, did not put strong
guards into the place, by which he might have prevented
his army's being brought into these extreme
necessities." Sir Richard Grenville possessed himself
of Lanbetherick, a strong house belonging to Lord
Roberts, and lying between the Parliamentarian army
and the little harbour, and Sir Jacob Astley made himself
master of View Hall, which was opposite to Fowey,
and then cut off supplies from reaching the camp of
Essex.</p>

<p>For eight or ten days the armies lay inactive, and
then Charles drew closer the toils in which the hostile
army was held. He drove them from a rising ground
called Beacon Hill, and immediately raised a square
work on it, and placed there a battery that threw a
plunging fire into their quarters. Then Goring was
sent with the greatest part of the royal horse, and
fifteen hundred foot, to S. Blazey, to drive the enemy
yet closer together, and to cut off the provisions they
received from that direction. The dashing, daring
Goring executed his commission with complete success,
and the Parliamentarians were reduced to that small strip
of land that lay between the river Fowey and that of
S. Blazey, which was not above two miles in breadth
and little more in width, and which had already been
eaten bare by the cavalry. The destruction of the
whole army now appeared inevitable; but through the
carelessness of Goring, one dark night all the horse of
the enemy were allowed to slip unperceived through
the lines, on the night of the 30th and 31st August,
1644, and the Earl of Essex with Lord Roberts and
many of his officers fought his way to the shore near
the mouth of the Fowey, and there they embarked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span>
board a ship which Warwick had sent round, and
sailed away to Plymouth on September 1st, leaving the
foot, cannon, and ammunition to the care of the gallant
Skippon, who had nothing left for it but to make the
best capitulation he could. Essex left Roberts in command
at Plymouth, which he successfully defended
against the attacks made during the ensuing months,
and his popularity is attested by the petitions made by
the Plymothians that he might be left in command of
the town.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts must have suffered considerably in
the Civil War, for his estates were alienated from him
and granted by the King to Sir Richard Grenville,
whilst his home of Lanhydrock was occupied by the
Royalists, and his children were detained from him.
He was a staunch Presbyterian, hating Prelacy, believing
in exclusive salvation, the perquisite of those
who believed in Calvin, and he had no love for the
Independents.</p>

<p>Since 1643 an assembly for the regulation of religion
had been sitting at Westminster. It had substituted
Presbyterianism for the Episcopacy, as the established
religion of England, and had abolished the Prayer
Book and issued in its stead a book called the Directory.
These changes had been confirmed by Parliament.
But this settlement of the religious question was quite
contrary to the views of the Army, which was mainly&mdash;at
all events that portion commanded by Cromwell in
the North&mdash;composed of Independents.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Vane, Oliver Cromwell, Nathaniel
Fiennes, and Oliver St. John, the solicitor-general,
were regarded as their leaders. Dissentions broke out
in the House of Commons; Cromwell and Lord Manchester
cast imputations on each other. Cromwell
desired to remodel the Army, of which the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</a></span>
Commons had already become suspicious, and how to
effect this project was the difficulty, and his object
could only be attained by a circuitous course. At his
instance a committee was chosen to frame what was
called the "Self-denying Ordinance," by which the
members of both Houses were excluded from all civil
and military employments, except a few offices which
were specified. After a great debate, the Ordinance
passed both Houses (April 3rd, 1645), and Essex,
Warwick, Manchester, Denbigh, Roberts, and many
others resigned their commands, and received the
thanks of Parliament for their past services.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts's zeal for the cause rapidly cooled. He
and Essex both protested against the passing of the
Ordinance on March 13th, 1646, that made the new
Presbyterian Established "Church" subordinate to
Parliament.</p>

<p>On January 3rd, 1648, it was passed in both Houses
that thenceforth no addresses should any more be sent
to the King; he was virtually dethroned, and the
whole constitution was formally overthrown; and by
orders from the Army the King was shut up in close
confinement, his servants removed, and his correspondence
with his friends prevented. When the
Army threatened to intervene, Roberts deemed it his
most prudent course to absent himself from the House
of Lords, and suffer the act to pass.</p>

<p>He took no part in the trial of the King, and after
the execution of Charles withdrew from further share
in public affairs. He was, however, not hostile to the
Protectorate, and at the Installation of the Protector
he suffered his son to be in his train.</p>

<p>At the Restoration he was received into favour, and
became a Privy Councillor, and was appointed Lord
Deputy of Ireland, and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span>
in May, 1661. In July, 1679, he was created Viscount
Bodmin and Earl of Radnor.</p>

<p>With the latter part of his life we have no concern, as
this article has to do only with the rise of the family of
Roberts to an Earldom from a store of wood and furze,
and the sordid desk of an usurer. Pepys, in his <i>Diary</i>,
describes him as "a very sober man," and Clarendon
as "a sullen, morose man, intolerably proud," and as
having a "dark countenance," and Burnet as a "sullen
and morose man." He died July 17th, 1685. His son
Robert seems to have deemed it expedient to differentiate
his family name from the thousands of Roberts's
in humble life, by the alteration of the spelling of the
name, by the transfer of the <i>e</i> and the addition of an <i>a</i>,
and the vulgar Roberts bloomed into Robartes.</p>

<p>The motto assumed by the first Lord Roberts, "quæ
supra" expressed the sincere aspiration of the man,
who was certainly sincere in seeking "those things
which are above," as the guiding principle of his life.</p>

<p>The Robartes or Roberts family became extinct in
the male line in 1757; but Mary Vere Robartes,
daughter of the Hon. Russell Robartes, married
Thomas Hunt, of Mollington, and left issue Thomas
Hunt, who had an only child, Anna Maria, who married
Charles Reginald Agar, third son of James,
Viscount Clifden, and carried the wealth of the
Robartes family into that of Agar; and in 1822
Thomas James Agar, her son, assumed the name and
arms of Robartes, and was created Baron Robartes of
Lanhydrock and Truro in 1869. The descent is, however,
so remote and through females, that the present
family can hardly be considered to represent the
original Robertes or Roberts stock.</p>

<h2>THEODORE PALEOLOGUS</h2>


<p>In the church of Landulph is a small brass attached
to the wall that bears the following inscription:
"Here lyeth the body of Theodore Paleologus,
of Pesaro in Italye, descended from y<sup>e</sup> Imperyal
lyne of y<sup>e</sup> last Christian emperors of Greece, being the
sonne of Camillio, y<sup>e</sup> sonne of Prosper, the sonne of
Theodoro, the sonne of John, y<sup>e</sup> sonne of Thomas,
second brother of Constantius Paleologus, the 8<sup>th</sup> of
that name, and last of y<sup>e</sup> lyne y<sup>t</sup> rayned in Constantinople
until subdued by the Turks, who married w<sup>t</sup>
Mary, y<sup>e</sup> daughter of William Balls, of Hadlye in
Souffolke, Gent., and had issue 5 children, Theodore,
John, Ferdinando, Maria, and Dorothy; and departed
this life at Clyfton, y<sup>e</sup> 21<sup>st</sup> of Jan<sup>y</sup> 1636." Above the
inscription are the imperial arms of the empire of
Byzantium&mdash;an eagle displayed with two heads, the
two legs resting upon two gates; the imperial crown
over the whole, and between the gates a crescent, for
difference as second son.</p>

<p>There were eight Emperors of the East of the family
of the Paleologi. The family descended from a General
Andronicus Paleologus, who died in 1246. The
Emperor Manuel, who deceased in 1425, had five sons:
John II, Emperor, who died in 1449; Theodore, despot
in Lacedemon; Andronicus, despot in Thessalonica;
Constantine, despot of the Morea. John II was associated
with his father, and succeeded him. Andronicus,
the second son, died of leprosy in 1429. Theodore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
Constantine, Demetrius, and Thomas wasted their
resources in mutual contests, but Theodore was constrained
to adopt the monastic profession. On the
death of John II the royal family was reduced to three
princes&mdash;Constantine, Demetrius, and Thomas. Demetrius
at once claimed the vacant throne, but failed in
his attempt, and Constantine succeeded, the last and
greatest of the Paleologi. "Demetrius and Thomas
now divided the Morea between them; but though
they had taken a solemn oath never to violate the
agreement, differences soon arose, and Thomas took
up arms to drive Demetrius out of his possessions;
Demetrius hereupon retired to Asan, his wife's brother,
by whose means he obtained succours from Amurath,
and compelled Thomas to submit the matters in dispute
to the Emperor's (Constantine's) arbitration. But
that prince refusing to deliver to his brother the
territories that fell to his share, Mohammed ordered
Thuraken, his governor in the Morea, to assist Demetrius."</p>

<p>Shortly after this, on the fatal May 29th, 1453, Constantinople
was taken by the Turks, and the gallant
Constantine was killed.</p>

<p>Immediately after the capture Mohammed proceeded
to make war on Demetrius and Thomas, whereupon
the Albanians, subjects of Thomas, revolted. Fresh
disputes broke out between the brothers, each endeavouring
to supplant the other, and in 1459 Mohammed
entered the Morea and reduced Corinth. At
the first news of his approach Thomas fled to Italy
with his wife and children, and Demetrius submitted
to the Sultan, who carried him away to Constantinople,
where he died in abject slavery in 1470. Thomas was
received in Italy by Pope Pius II in 1461, who allowed
him a pension of six thousand ducats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span></p>

<p>Historians record only two sons, Andrew and Manuel,
but according to the inscription in Landulph church
there was a third, John, whom Italian writers have not
mentioned.</p>

<p>Andrew, the eldest, married a woman from the streets
of Rome, and dying childless, in 1502, bequeathed his
empty honours to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,
having previously sold them to Charles VIII of France.
Manuel Paleologus, the second son, revisited his
native country. He was granted a train of Christians
and Moslems to attend him to his grave. Gibbon says:
"If there be some animals of so generous a nature that
they refuse to propagate in a domestic state, the last of
the imperial race must be ascribed to an inferior kind;
he accepted from the Sultan's liberality two beautiful
females; and his surviving son was lost in the habit
and religion of a Turkish slave." Thomas, who had
been despot of Morea, died in 1465. By his wife,
Catherine Zaccaria, he had one daughter, in addition
to the sons mentioned, and this was Helen, who married
Lazarus II, King of Servia, and died in 1474.</p>

<p>Why Theodore Paleologus came to England we do
not know, but possibly in the train of Sir Henry Killigrew
and Sir Nicholas Lower. Sir Nicholas had
married Sir Henry's daughter, and as they were both
advanced in life and childless they may have been
disposed to befriend the Paleologi, and Lady Killigrew
was one of the learned daughters of Sir Anthony Coke,
celebrated for her knowledge of Greek, and she may
have inspired her daughter, Lady Lower, with the
same fondness for the classic languages. This is but
conjecture; but this at least is certain, that the Paleologi
were given Clifton, in Landulph, as their residence, and
this was a mansion that belonged to the Lowers.</p>

<p>Theodore Paleologus married Mary Balls in 1615,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span>
and by her had three sons, Theodore, John, and Ferdinando,
and two daughters.</p>

<p>Theodore was a lieutenant in the Parliamentary
army in 1642, under Lord St. John, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey in 1644.</p>

<p>There are no traces to be found of John and Ferdinando.
Mary, one of the daughters of Theodore and
Mary Balls, died unmarried, and was buried at Landulph
in 1674. Her sister Dorothy married, in 1656, William
Arundell, and died in 1681, he in 1684.</p>

<p>There was a Theodore Paleologus who died at sea
on board the <i>Charles II</i> under Captain Gibson, in
1693. In his will Theodore mentions only his wife
Martha, and we do not know who was his father.</p>

<p>We do not know who was the William Arundell
whom Dorothy Paleologus married. Unhappily the
registers of S. Dominic, where she and her husband
lived, have been lost, and we cannot say whether the
Mary Arundell who married a Francis Lee soon after
the death of her presumed parents was a daughter.
But if so, as Dr. Jago suggests in a paper in the
<i>Archæologia</i>, "The imperial blood perhaps still flows
in the bargemen of Cargreen."</p>

<h2>THE WORKS OF
ANATOLE FRANCE</h2>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_916.jpg" id="i_916.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/i_916.jpg" alt="ANATOLE FRANCE" title="ANATOLE FRANCE" />
</div>

<p>It has long been a reproach to
England that only one volume
by ANATOLE FRANCE
has been adequately rendered
into English; yet outside this
country he shares with
TOLSTOI the distinction
of being the greatest and most daring
student of humanity now living.</p>

<p>¶ There have been many difficulties to
encounter in completing arrangements for a
uniform edition, though perhaps the chief barrier
to publication here has been the fact that
his writings are not for babes&mdash;but for men
and the mothers of men. Indeed, some of his
Eastern romances are written with biblical candour.
"I have sought truth strenuously," he
tells us, "I have met her boldly. I have never
turned from her even when she wore an
unexpected aspect." Still, it is believed that the day has
come for giving English versions of all his imaginative
works, as well as of his monumental study JOAN OF
ARC, which is undoubtedly the most discussed book in the
world of letters to-day.</p>

<p>¶ MR. JOHN LANE has pleasure in announcing that
he will commence publication of the works of M.
ANATOLE FRANCE in English, under the general
editorship of MR. FREDERIC CHAPMAN, with the
following volumes:</p>

<p>
THE RED LILY<br />
MOTHER OF PEARL<br />
THE GARDEN OF EPICURUS<br />
THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD<br />
JOCASTA AND THE FAMISHED CAT<br />
BALTHASAR<br />
THE WELL OF ST. CLARE<br />
THE ELM TREE ON THE MALL<br />
THE WICKER-WORK WOMAN<br />
AT THE SIGN OF THE QUEEN PÉDAUQUE<br />
THE OPINIONS OF JEROME COIGNARD<br />
MY FRIEND'S BOOK<br />
THE ASPIRATIONS OF JEAN SERVIEN<br />
THAÏS<br />
JOAN OF ARC (2 vols.)<br />
</p>

<p>¶ All the books will be published at 6/- each with the
exception of JOAN OF ARC, which will be 25/- net
the two volumes, with eight Illustrations.</p>

<p>¶ The format of the volumes leaves little to be desired.
The size is Demy 8vo (9 × 5&frac34; in.), that of this Prospectus, and
they will be printed from Caslon type upon a paper light in
weight and strong in texture, with a cover design in crimson
and gold, a gilt top, end-papers from designs by Aubrey
Beardsley and initials by Henry Ospovat. In short, these are
volumes for the bibliophile as well as the lover of fiction,
and form perhaps the cheapest library edition of copyright
novels ever published, for the price is only that of an
ordinary novel.</p>

<p>¶ The translation of these books has been entrusted to such
competent French scholars as <span class="smcap">mr. alfred allinson</span>, <span class="smcap">hon.
maurice baring</span>, <span class="smcap">mr. frederic chapman</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</a></span>, <span class="smcap">mr. robert b.</span>
<span class="smcap">douglas</span>, <span class="smcap">mr. a. w. evans</span>, <span class="smcap">mrs. farley</span>, <span class="smcap">mr. lafcadio
hearn</span>, <span class="smcap">mrs. john lane</span>, <span class="smcap">mrs. newmarch</span>, <span class="smcap">mr. c. e. roche</span>,
<span class="smcap">miss winifred stephens</span>, and <span class="smcap">miss m. p. willcocks</span>.</p>

<p>¶ As Anatole Thibault, <i>dit</i> Anatole France, is to most
English readers merely a name, it will be well to state that
he was born in 1844 in the picturesque and inspiring
surroundings of an old bookshop on the Quai Voltaire,
Paris, kept by his father, Monsieur Thibault, an authority on
eighteenth-century history, from whom the boy caught the
passion for the principles of the Revolution, while from his
mother he was learning to love the ascetic ideals chronicled
in the Lives of the Saints. He was schooled with the lovers
of old books, missals and manuscripts; he matriculated on
the Quais with the old Jewish dealers of curios and <i>objets d'art</i>;
he graduated in the great university of life and experience.
It will be recognised that all his work is permeated by his
youthful impressions; he is, in fact, a virtuoso at large.</p>

<p>¶ He has written about thirty volumes of fiction. His
first novel was JOCASTA &amp; THE FAMISHED CAT
(1879). THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD
appeared in 1881, and had the distinction of being crowned
by the French Academy, into which he was received in 1896.</p>

<p>¶ His work is illuminated with style, scholarship, and
psychology; but its outstanding features are the lambent wit,
the gay mockery, the genial irony with which he touches every
subject he treats. But the wit is never malicious, the mockery
never derisive, the irony never barbed. To quote from his own
GARDEN OF EPICURUS: "Irony and Pity are both of
good counsel; the first with her smiles makes life agreeable,
the other sanctifies it to us with her tears. The Irony I
invoke is no cruel deity. She mocks neither love nor
beauty. She is gentle and kindly disposed. Her mirth
disarms anger and it is she teaches us to laugh at rogues and
fools whom but for her we might be so weak as to hate."</p>

<p>¶ Often he shows how divine humanity triumphs over
mere asceticism, and with entire reverence; indeed, he
might be described as an ascetic overflowing with humanity,
just as he has been termed a "pagan, but a pagan
constantly haunted by the pre-occupation of Christ."
He is in turn&mdash;like his own Choulette in THE RED
LILY&mdash;saintly and Rabelaisian, yet without incongruity.
At all times he is the unrelenting foe of superstition and
hypocrisy. Of himself he once modestly said: "You will find
in my writings perfect sincerity (lying demands a talent I do
not possess), much indulgence, and some natural affection for
the beautiful and good."</p>

<p>¶ The mere extent of an author's popularity is perhaps a
poor argument, yet it is significant that two books by this
author are in their HUNDRED AND TENTH THOUSAND,
and numbers of them well into their SEVENTIETH
THOUSAND, whilst the one which a Frenchman recently
described as "Monsieur France's most arid book" is in its
FIFTY-EIGHTH THOUSAND.</p>

<p>¶ Inasmuch as M. FRANCE'S ONLY contribution to
an English periodical appeared in THE YELLOW BOOK,
vol. v., April 1895, together with the first important English
appreciation of his work from the pan of the Hon. Maurice
Baring, it is peculiarly appropriate that the English edition
of his works should be issued from the Bodley Head.</p>

                <p class="center">A FEW PRESS OPINIONS.</p>
                <p><i>Daily News.</i>&mdash;"A fascinating series ... the whole book
 is rich in human interest. It is by these personal touches,
 drawn from tradition and memoirs, that the dead men,
 surrounded by the curious panoply of their time, are made to
 live again in Mr. Baring-Gould's pages."<br /><br />

 <i>Westminster Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Fascinating reading ... a book
 which is 'cider and cream' to West Country folk, and is
 extremely interesting to all who are attracted by human
 documents which are out of the common."<br /><br />

 <i>Globe.</i>&mdash;"For a Christmas present to a West Countryman
 Mr. Baring-Gould's book is unsurpassed.... The volume is
 full of good stories."<br /><br />

 <span class="smcap">M. P. Willcocks</span> in <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.&mdash;"The
 writing of such a book as 'Devonshire Characters' is a kind
 of intelligent ancestor worship.... The illustrations are
 curiously fascinating, and there are fifty-eight of them
 in the book, which has also an excellent index."<br /><br />

 <i>Scotsman.</i>&mdash;"Full of out of the way learning, and
 always brightly written ... an uncommonly interesting and
 instructive book...."<br /><br />

 <i>Times.</i>&mdash;"... A more entertaining crew than these
 Devonshire Characters it would be impossible to find; and
 the book that perpetuates their memory is excellent reading
 from cover to cover...."<br /><br />

 <i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"... No writer of modern times
 has so fully breathed the spirit of the West as Mr.
 Baring-Gould...."<br /><br />

 <i>Birmingham Post.</i>&mdash;"Mr. S. Baring-Gould shows himself
 to be very much alive in 'Devonshire Characters,' and we
 cannot recall a case in which his astonishing literary s
 energies have been put to more interesting use ... a
 handsome as well as interesting addition to every
 library...."<br /><br />

 <i>Western Daily Mercury.</i>&mdash;"... We can most strenuously
 advise all Devonshire men and women who have either a love
 for their county, or a love for a good book, or both, to buy
 'Devonshire Characters.' They will never regret it."<br /><br />

 <i>Guardian.</i>&mdash;"... The eccentric lives and the evil
 courses of the odd and the profligate have ever afforded
 more stirring reading than the improving careers of the
 good, and where we might idly turn the pages of Prince, we
 must needs follow with keen interest the roads traversed by
 Mr. Baring-Gould's villains and eccentrics, often to the
 gallows, or the county gaol, or into the weird old legends
 of the West...."<br /><br />

 <i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;"... His latest work will probably
 enjoy a longer popularity than anything else that he has
 done. It is a work that for all West Country folk will have
 a lasting fascination, dealing as it does with a large
 number of worthies and unworthies, celebrated people and
 notorious people, who have been associated with the county."</p>

<p>&#8258; <i>Ralph Heathcote, the son of an English father and an Alsatian mother, was for
some time in the English diplomatic service as first secretary to Mr. Brook Taylor, minister
at the Court of Hesse, and on one occasion found himself very near to making history.
Napoleon became persuaded that Taylor was implicated in a plot to procure his assassination,
and insisted on his dismissal from the Hessian Court. As Taylor refused to be
dismissed, the incident at one time seemed likely to result to the Elector in the loss of his
throne. Heathcote came into contact with a number of notable people, including the Miss
Berrys, with whom he assures his mother he is not in love. On the whole, there is much
interesting material for lovers of old letters and journals.</i></p></blockquote>

description of the intrigue and dare-devil spirit which flourished unchecked at the French
Court.... Mr. Richard Whiteing's introduction is written with restraint and dignity."</p>

<p><i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;"It is a really fascinating story, or series of stories, set forth in this
volume.... Here are anecdotes innumerable of the brilliant women of the Second Empire,
so that in reading the book we are not only dazzled by the beauty and gorgeousness
of everything, but we are entertained by the record of things said and done, and through
all we are conscious of the coming 'gloom and doom' so soon to overtake the Court.
Few novels possess the fascination of this spirited work, and many readers will hope that
the author will carry out his proposal of giving us a further series of memories of the
'Women of the Second Empire.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Times.</i>&mdash;"A most illuminating commentary on Tchaikovsky's music."</p>

<p><i>World.</i>&mdash;"One of the most fascinating self-revelations by an artist which has been given to
the world. The translation is excellent, and worth reading for its own sake."</p>

<p><i>Contemporary Review.</i>&mdash;"The book's appeal is, of course, primarily to the music-lover; but
there is so much of human and literary interest in it, such intimate revelation of a
singularly interesting personality, that many who have never come under the spell of
the Pathetic Symphony will be strongly attracted by what is virtually the spiritual
autobiography of its composer. High praise is due to the translator and editor for the
literary skill with which she has prepared the English version of this fascinating work....
There have been few collections of letters published within recent years that give so
vivid a portrait of the writer as that presented to us in these pages."</p></blockquote>

<p>THE DIARY OF A LADY-IN-WAITING. By

Times of George the Fourth. Interspersed with original Letters
from the late Queen Caroline and from various other distinguished
persons. New edition. Edited, with an Introduction, by <span class="smcap">A.
Francis Steuart</span>. With numerous portraits. Two Vols.
Demy 8vo. 21<i>s.</i> net.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>This book, which appeared anonymously in 1838, created an enormous sensation,
and was fiercely criticised by Thackeray and in the Reviews of the time. There is no
doubt that it was founded on the diary of Lady Charlotte Bury, daughter of the 5th Duke
of Argyll, and Lady-in-Waiting to the unfortunate Caroline of Brunswick, when
Princess of Wales. It deals, therefore, with the curious Court of the latter and with the
scandals that occurred there, as well as with the strange vagaries of the Princess abroad.
In this edition names left blank in the original have been (where possible) filled up, and
many notes are given by the Editor to render it useful to the ever-increasing number of
readers interested in the later Georgian Period.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>THE DAUGHTER OF LOUIS XVI.: Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte
of France, Duchesse D'Angoulême. By <span class="smcap">G.
Lenotre</span>. With 13 Full-page Illustrations. Demy 8vo.
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>M. G. Lenotre is perhaps the most widely read of a group of modern French writers
who have succeeded in treating history from a point of view at once scientific, dramatic
and popular. He has made the Revolution his particular field of research, and deals not
only with the most prominent figures of that period, but with many minor characters
whose life-stories are quite as thrilling as anything in fiction. The localities in which
these dramas were enacted are vividly brought before us in his works, for no one has
reconstructed 18th century Paris with more picturesque and accurate detail. "The
Daughter of Louis XVI." is quite equal in interest and literary merit to any of the
volumes which have preceded it, not excepting the famous Drama of Varennes. As usual,
M. Lenotre draws his material largely from contemporary documents, and among the
most remarkable memoirs reproduced in this book are "The Story of my Visit to the
Temple" by Harmand de la Meuse, and the artless, but profoundly touching narrative of
the unhappy orphaned Princess: "A manuscript written by Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte
of France upon the captivity of the Princes and Princesses, her relatives, imprisoned in
the Temple." The illustrations are a feature of the volume and include the so-called
"telescope" portrait of the Princess, sketched from life by an anonymous artist, stationed
at a window opposite her prison in the tower of the Temple.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>HUBERT AND JOHN VAN EYCK: Their Life
and Work. By <span class="smcap">W. H. James Weale</span>. With 41 Photogravure

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir Martin Conway's Note.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Nearly half a century has passed since Mr. W. H. James Weale, then resident at
Bruges, began that long series of patient investigations into the history of Netherlandish
art which was destined to earn so rich a harvest. When he began work Memlinc was
still called Hemling, and was fabled to have arrived at Bruges as a wounded soldier.
The van Eycks were little more than legendary heroes. Roger Van der Weyden was little
more than a name. Most of the other great Netherlandish artists were either wholly
forgotten or named only in connection with paintings with which they had nothing to do.
Mr. Weale discovered Gerard David, and disentangled his principal works from Memlinc's,
with which they were then confused. During a series of years he published in the
"Beffroi," a magazine issued by himself, the many important records from ancient
archives which threw a flood of light upon the whole origin and development of the early
Netherlandish school. By universal admission he is hailed all over Europe as the father
of this study. It is due to him in great measure that the masterpieces of that school,
which by neglect were in danger of perishing fifty years ago, are now recognised as among
the most priceless treasures of the Museums of Europe and the United States. The
publication by him, therefore, in the ripeness of his years and experience, of the result of
his studies on the van Eycks is a matter of considerable importance to students of art
history. Lately, since the revived interest in the works of the Early French painters has
attracted the attention of untrained speculators to the superior schools of the Low
Countries, a number of wild theories have been started which cannot stand upright in the
face of recorded facts. A book is now needed which will set down all those facts in full
and accurate form. Fullness and accuracy are the characteristics of all Mr. Weale's work.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>VINCENZO FOPPA OF BRESCIA, <span class="smcap">Founder of
the Lombard School, His Life and Work</span>. By <span class="smcap">Constance
Jocelyn Ffoulkes</span> and <span class="smcap">Monsignor Rodolfo Majocchi, d.d.</span>,
Rector of the Collegio Borromeo, Pavia. Based on research in the
Archives of Milan, Pavia, Brescia, and Genoa, and on the study
of all his known works. With over 100 Illustrations, many in
Photogravure, and 100 Documents. Royal 4to. £3. 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>No complete Life of Vincenco Foppa, one of the greatest of the North Italian
Masters, has ever been written: an omission which seems almost inexplicable in these days
of over-production in the matter of biographies of painters, and of subjects relating to the
art of Italy. In Milanese territory&mdash;the sphere of Foppa's activity during many years&mdash;he
was regarded by his contemporaries as unrivalled in his art, and his right to be
considered the head and founder of the Lombard school is undoubted. His influence was
powerful and far-reaching, extending eastwards beyond the limits of Brescian territory,
and south and westwards to Liguria and Piedmont. In the Milanese district it was
practically dominant for over a quarter of a century, until the coming of Leonardo da
Vinci thrust Foppa and his followers into the shade, and induced him to abandon Pavia,
which had been his home for more than thirty years, and to return to Brescia. The object
of the authors of this book has been to present a true picture of the master's life based
upon the testimony of records in Italian archives; all facts hitherto known relating
to him have been brought together; all statements have been verified; and a great deal of
new and unpublished material has been added. The authors have unearthed a large
amount of new material relating to Foppa, one of the most interesting facts brought to
light being that he lived for twenty-three years longer than was formerly supposed. The
illustrations will include several pictures by Foppa hitherto unknown in the history of art,
and others which have never before been published, as well as reproductions of every
existing work by the master at present known.</i></p></blockquote>

French of Vincent d'Indy. And with an Introduction by <span class="smcap">Rosa
Newmarch</span>. Demy 8vo. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>There is no purer influence in modern music than that of César Franck, for many
years ignored in every capacity save that of organist of Sainte-Clotilde, in Paris, but now
recognised as the legitimate successor of Bach and Beethoven. His inspiration "rooted in
love and faith" has contributed in a remarkable degree to the regeneration of the musical
art in France and elsewhere. The now famous "Schola Cantorum," founded in Paris in
1896, by A. Guilmant, Charles Bordes and Vincent d'Indy, is the direct outcome of his
influence. Among the artists who where in some sort his disciples were Paul Dukas,
Chabrier, Gabriel Fauré and the great violinist Ysäye. His pupils include such gifted
composers as Benoît, Augusta Holmès, Chausson, Ropartz, and d'Indy. This book,
written with the devotion of a disciple and the authority of a master, leaves us with
a vivid and touching impression of the saint-like composer of "The Beatitudes."</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><i>Daily Chronicle.</i>&mdash;"Few, indeed, could be more fit to sing the dirge of that 'Virgil of
Prose' than the poet whose <i>curiosa felicitas</i> is so close akin to Stevenson's own charm."</p>

<p><i>Globe.</i>&mdash;"The opening Elegy on R. L. Stevenson includes some tender and touching
passages, and has throughout the merits of sincerity and clearness."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><i>Guardian.</i>&mdash;"One of the cleverest pieces of criticism we have come across for a long time."</p>

<p><i>Scotsman.</i>&mdash;"It shows a keen insight into the essential qualities of literature, and analyses
Mr. Kipling's product with the skill of a craftsman ... the positive and outstanding
merits of Mr. Kipling's contribution to the literature of his time are marshalled by his
critic with quite uncommon skill."</p></blockquote>

Critical Essay on "Echoes from Theocritus." Photogravure
Portrait. Crown 8vo. 5<i>s.</i> net.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><i>The Times.</i>&mdash;"... the leading features of the sonnets are the writer's intense sympathy
with human life in general and with young life in particular; his humour, his music, and,
in a word, the quality which 'leaves a melody afloat upon the brain, a savour on the
mental palate.'"</p>

<p><i>Bookman.</i>&mdash;"The Memoir, by Mr. W. A. Gill, is a sympathetic sketch of an earnest and
lovable character; and the critical estimate, by J. Addington Symonds, is a charmingly-written
and suggestive essay."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>The book, which is largely autobiographical, describes the effect of diffidence upon
an individual life, and contains, with a consideration of the nature of shyness, a plea for
a kindlier judgment of the inveterate case.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><i>Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Leith has written a very beautiful book, and perhaps the publisher's
claim that this will be a new classic is not too bold."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><i>Daily Chronicle.</i>&mdash;"It is a remarkable thing and probably unique, that a writer of such
personality as the author of 'Between the Acts' should not only feel, but boldly put
on paper, his homage and complete subjection to the genius of one after another of
these men. He is entirely free from that one common virtue of critics, which is
superiority to the author criticised."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Literary World.</i>&mdash;"The book is altogether entertaining; it is brisk, lively, and
effective. Mr. Watt has already, in his two series of 'The Law's Lumber Room,'
established his place as an essayist in legal lore, and the present book will increase his
reputation."</p></blockquote>


<p>CHAMPIONS OF THE FLEET. Captains and

<span class="smcap">Edward Fraser</span>. With 16 Full-page Illustrations. Crown 8vo.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8258; <i>Mr. Fraser takes in the whole range of our Navy's story. First there is the story
of the "Dreadnought," told for the first time: how the name was originally selected by
Elizabeth, why she chose it, the launch, how under Drake she fought against the
Armada, how her captain was knighted on the quarter-deck in the presence of the enemy.
From this point the name is traced down to the present leviathan which bears it. This is
but one of the "champions" dealt with in Mr. Fraser's volume, which is illustrated by
some very interesting reproductions.</i></p></blockquote>
